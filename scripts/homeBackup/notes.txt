Idea:

Files stored on Linux computer in:

/home/jasonrohrer/backups/BACKUP_A

Two USB thumb drives, BACKUP_A and BACKUP_B mounted at:

/media/jasonrohrer/BACKUP_A
/media/jasonrohrer/BACKUP_B

LaCie Rugged Raid Pro mounted at:
/media/jasonrohrer/LaCie

At least one full archive copy (cp -a) of BACKUP_A in top level of LaCie drive.


First, clone to sticks:
cd /media/jasonrohrer/BACKUP_A
bash cloneFromDrive.sh
bash cloneToB.sh

Then, make incremental backup to LaCie:

cd ~/backups/BACKUP_A
bash incrementalToLaCie.sh
