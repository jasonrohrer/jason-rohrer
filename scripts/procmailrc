# The message that we send on autoreply

BOUNCE_MESSAGE="Since this email address has been overrun by spam (200 spam messages per day), I have switched to a different address for personal correspondence.  This new address, in robot-proof form, is
jcr13 AT users DOT sf DOT net
Translate this into a real address by pretending that I just read that over the phone to you:  replace AT with @ and each DOT with a period.  If you are having trouble with the new address, a variety of other pieces of contact information are available on my web page:  http://jasonrohrer.n3.net"


# Auto reply to all message to rohrer@cse.ucsc.edu or rohrer@soe.ucsc.edu
# DO NOT autoreply to messages from other "ucsc" addresses (like sysadmins)
# DO NOT autoreply to messages from daemons
# DO NOT autoreply to messages that may be looping from this autoreply aready
#
# the "c" flag makes sure that this message is passed on to the next recipe
# no matter what (even if it is delivered by this recipe)
# In this case, since there are no other recipes, we still deliver all
# messages to the default location.
#
# After testing, and determining that this actually works, I am turning the
# c flag off so that messages that are autoreplied are not actually delivered.
