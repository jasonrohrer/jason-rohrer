My Girls
9-4-96

Stall me over
Nothing notice
Once where was it?
now you're gone

Sifting somewhat
hair forever
Gosh you're lovely
(touch me please)

Love is angry 
Now you're joking
laugh my head off
God is dead

Pull from somewhere
pretty flower
Wake you softly
Dream again



Perceptions
9-22-96

They sat there
on a bench and 
argued,
both with their 
slow stupid tongues,
both speaking their
own versions of 
first grade English.
    Listen you
    you fucking listen
    tomorrow I get paid
    then you see.
    I see?  I see!
    Money?  Is that all you?
    Money?  Me to you just money?
I turned as I passed 
them, listening, fixed,
fascinated
by a different world.

A black boy
walked past me
punching the air. 



The When
9-29-96

I don't want you
You know
Pretty bird
with hair all
over
   like Einstein
on a good day
of quantum physics
and E=MC2.
(He had more important
things to worry about.)

I've only really seen 
   you once
but I was never drunk
   never been drunk
never even tasted coffee
(if you can believe that one).

There are some things
   that one never
Knows like
   "Why?"
And
   "How much will it hurt
     when I lose you?"

But I can laugh it off
   gotta laugh it off
   gotta laugh

And I don't want you,
   I /want you/

Shaken Down
10-25-96

tripping
tapering
spilling
laughing gods all
    come down
    today.
    Why it tickles
    your noses
    your senses
    with too much
    too much life
    and death
All at once
on this morning air,
Overflowing color
tearing,
spilling,
filling the valley below






11-10-96

the flowers 
the flowers in angel dust
sing
sweetly
forevery     day gone by.
this heart,
this old and living,
smiling child will grow
among people and pets,
all together
    and how many times
    and how lines do show
by god and forsaken 
dreams
she thrives, 
next to human hope
and beastie passion
there with the eyes of the world
there with the flowers too,
    reaching desperately,
    day by day.




12-5-96

in the end lies the beginning,
the impermanence of

god god help please
lead lost love astray
wishing friends 
wising language for to explain
for to laugh with the 

rivers and oceans
oceans and life
eternal yet gone forever
lifting up smashed down
with the sun and 

i remember when
i lost my face in the fire
lost my heart to the rocks below
the waves on time
the god in his house
alone

there lives
therein loves
wander not for long
but keep walking





1-31-97

talk about wastelands
talk about the future
nuclear winter
hell-bound summer
shepherds in pulpits
and podiums,
but everyone dead 
in the audience,
dead in the blue
talk-box halo
of living rooms and chairs.
Angels of gold
and heaven on earth
live forever on earth
in a tube,
in a tank of human
atrocity,
our sacred chemistry,
one ray of hope in the
next wave of magic,
the new godless miracle,
(with all of our dreaming)
a chance to go home.




1-31-97

around this finger
this world
a ring of steel and light,
life in a jar
a bug with a small boy watching.
see the break
of happiness with night
and moonless stars,
three moons, even.
me in my face 
in my grayness in my passion
listening to the angry 
monotone
the cycle of things









1-31-97

hands an extension,
eyes closed, hair down
feel this.
A many little heart has
broken by now
a too-many man
a watcher, nobody.
sink sank sung a whistle
laughed a voice to me
pleaseness please me.
weight and darkness
too light to even feel
too vacant to remember
too thin to hide a kiss.






sadness 1
2-9-97

it must be rain
this time
not blue but black
or gold.
gold sounds lonely
crazy angry at the world
sopping wet
and whispering

get out,
strange sounds,
broken music,
too weird for tonight,
too bright for the purple
clouds that cover everything.
filter through like
black water,
a thin vine of shiver.





2-16-97

what
what does me mean?
where goes no streaming smile
this is too long
this is too lonely
my me mine
more than once.

sifter, shadow heart
says the moon.

slippered tongues
shining hands
sore-worn eyes
fill the frame.

too loud
too hearts
mend as one
lift as two
forced laugher
love lasts forever.





3-30-97

listen, hey
my head heart falling off,
smile please,
gone lips, teeth so small and dull,
arms so weak
no swinging from trees today.
fill the forget sounds,
the lost talk,
the little break with small stones.
chink the damn,
with a stick or a herring, 
and walk away.
closed eyes can't see the water
open hearts don't feel pain these days.
smile would you
for this old movie,
this long demon of a comedy routine.
the slap stick is broken, I'm too big now,
too old for tears to make them laugh,
painted makeup frown now,
a real smile instead in searing colors,
the mask worn inside-out.




4-6-97

can barely hear the clunk
of pipes now.
too late for pressure change--
darkness makes people sleep.
dimness here, though,
not real dark.  fake plastic
night, silver curtains of 
light stars and cloud cover.
stale breeze, smokeless air
cleans hair and clothes,
right through the skin.
can sleep the wind, 
the night's slow breath, 
can wash away the evening.





landing
4-19-97

here behind this glass,
smoked for sunset,
on a non-comfortable chair.
wait for forgotten love
to land,
to smile and trip-toe
down the ramp to me.
it's night now,
no planes, only lights
coming and going,
no one else here now,
just me and a sweeper,
sopping up silence with 
lost luggage
and a worn-out p.a.






4-27-97

is it time now,
for something whispers again,
someone motions in the back
and I'm climbing off the stage.
is this all   ?
is this the end,
the final finality,
the breaking broken zenith?
a sunrise cracked in two,
and all the smothered night
spilling out like death's
lonely reason





From emails to katie after her lesbianity:


10-2-97

you know, the air was cold here tonight,
but walking back, silence cracked the night
as wind so oft breaks the thin new ice.
I wonder about the frost, sometimes,
I watch it kill everything.
So many successful ventures,
and even more glorious failures,
so proud.  god i suck.
i don't believe in poetry.



10-2-97

There was a girl once,
and everyone she knew hated her.
Needless to say she speculated much
about the true feelings of all those
who didn't know her yet.
There was a girl once,
and every where she went
life was tough on her.
Needless to say she speculated much
on the texture of life in all the places
she hadn't been yet.
There was a girl once,
and she found herself one
early morning with a friend.




10-3-97

god i miss the flowers now,
dying in the autumn sun like
butterflies, as yellow as their name implies.
A petal on my cheek, on lips that long
to eat the freshness of pollen,
long to do a bee's work in the spring.
