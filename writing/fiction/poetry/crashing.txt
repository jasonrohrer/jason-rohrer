[Saturday March 9, 2002]

feet at the lip
then pebbles slipping
    footing lost and falling

rocks jag and tear,
tumbling bones smash across boulders,
sky spins past,
    over and over and over.


(bloody now,
    and still more coming)


leaves are fluttering, flapping, slapping,
twigs and sticks are poking, jabbing,
bark of branches scraping, shredding,
and ever still the ground's approaching.


(quick estimate:
    300 milliseconds and counting)


colors blur as speed's increasing and 
one last thought slips through my mind as if to taunt me tease me anger me calm me save me but all I see is ground all ground the world is 100% pure grade-A ground if you only look close enough.

caught

not 
by hungry ground

caught by your arms
caught to nestle in your arms
caught to heal in your arms
caught to sleep in your arms.

the blowing wind and broken boughs and dumped cradles drift
into dreams,
like fragments of a mother's song
