7-16-98

found beneath the breath of night
my life revolves around your eyes,
a planet for such a sun,
dust for two deep-pure galaxies.
your sadness melts me





place of
7-16-98

giant rocks set up for someone to see
lifted there for you, for us
with mossy green tops
and damp undersides.
a swamp, perhaps,
or an old lake,
turned and tortured by years of seasons,
green with envy for our love.



...
7-17-98

all to real,
this moment,
this touched time, the longing air
knows only the joy of holding your scent.
with softness that puts the jealous air to shame
you come to me in a dream.
"hush," you say,
stealing my sleeping mind with a light, ambling kiss.
