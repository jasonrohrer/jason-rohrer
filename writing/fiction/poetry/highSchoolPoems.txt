Poetry

(from high school)

One time,
Long ago,
I was of the forest.
I grew lean and strong and
Brown.
Naked in the minds of others,
Loved by my true friends,
The trees.



Not You

Not 
You next to me
All the time
Leaves me 
To be with the 
Emptiness
That is not you.
Your hand
Miniature
Not in mine
Is my hand reaching
As I fall and
Grasping the nothing 
That is not you.
Like the dream
Closing with the light,
On the inside looking
Out.
The out is cold,
But every time I leave 
You.
Knowing,
Not together every every.
Last night
The tears
Came.















Trees

Understanding
Why the leaves must
Fall
So soon,
One by one.
To be a 
Needle
And stand forever,
Never
Cringing with the
Frost.
Death is gray
And cold.
The colors 
Vanish with the
Tides 
That bring a 
New
Forever.




My Dusk

Looking up,
The gray sky
Above.
Red in the west
Of fire and passion,
The sun
Relives the
Glory of the 
Day.
Looking east,
The blue takes over
And the cloudless
Rain
Of
Your
Eyes.











The sand
Of the last hand
(Finally)
Trickles and blows
Around my soul
Of thought.
Sand that
Lasts forever
But not in
Me or
Of you.
The dark loneliness
Not known until
Now,
The non-thinkable
Ever
Forever
Someday.
(finally)




Down Below

The people
Put away
The children
Screaming,
Naked,
Dead.
Me in the 
Tower
Gun 
At my side.
Orders
Not followed
But on my face
The
Guilt
Of just standing there.
What can I do?
The single revolutionary
Twisting
Dream of one man.
Causing
Building
Shoveling.
All of this.
One
Man.



A moment of thought

The one tree notion
Following my hand
Over the hills that 
Once were of me
But only for this is 
My arm tingling and
This is not the feeling 
Of your smell in
The morning of my figure (foot)
And seeing this I should
Die for not to be here
Once again this being 
Me and you but not
Of this.



Matters

The forest
And the love that once
Was.
I have the feeling
Of the rushing by 
Of my time.
Thinking the things I once
Thought.
Feelings stripped and washed
Away.
What was once so 
Important
Is now just a drop of rain 
In the 
Desert.


















Skin

Seeing the touch
Feeling your voice
Flowing
From hand to hand.
The heat of your
Blood.
The red and golden
Shimmer of power
Pulsing and living
In one
Single
Growing
Screaming
Touch.



Forever Mortal

Into the woods
And past the big rocks
There's something quite powerful
There.
Down to the bank
And under the waves
There's something that kills everyone.
The man on the heath
In the tattered old cloak
Has much to show 
To those who will see.
Launch your gaze
Over the plains
And across my face.
There's some part of me
Over there.



Slip Away

Burning the skin,
I screamed,
Dropping the ember.
And sinking into 
The snow,
It left with a wisp
Of blue steam.
Breathing your eyes 
For one last time
The cough will tear out
My soul.



Seasons

The scream
And forever
Of my skin (it won't last).
The joy of seeing the
Feeling in color
Of glittering pain,
Shimmering in the day
Like the moon laden
Blue grass.
The firefly hopes
And the scent of the 
Fall cannot compare
To the cold, hard
Understanding of
Winter.



Us

The flash
Of shimmering
Star breath
Skin swirls
Under rushing tides
And waterfall feathered
Sea spoken currents.
The moss covered 
Sun
And the cloud laden
Moon
Come together at last 
To embrace the light.
All of the forces 
Of life and of
Death promise that we will
Never let go.
Holding you,
Like the rain,
Impossible, yet 
So perfect.











You

Your skin,
Moonlight
On clouded
Water.
Your eyes,
The earth.
Your laugh
A thousand songs
Of one perfect
Minstrel wind in the 
Reeds.
Your kiss,
A brook sliding
Over slippery stones
Towards the sea.
You, 
A creature the sun
Has forgotten,
May melt one day
Into endless
Puddles of cloudless
Love.



My Sadness

Your tear
On my hand
A sweet moondrop that
Can only be wiped
Away by
Pain.
A beautiful moment,
Your
Tear filled windows
Shining down from
Above.
To feel your hand
One more time,
Or spend eternity in
An empty place
With no moon.
To see your tears,
I cry for you.







Moon Night

To see the moon
Glowing on 
The soft thick night,
Like no other star,
Opens the heart
To the deeper realm
Of dreams and enchantment.
The sparkle
Shimmer lust of
Moon on frost
Lends the appearance
Of ghosts in the
Corner,
Of fairy feathered
Crackling leaves
In the air.
Embracing the
Moon,
Her presence
Surrounds you,
Holding you even
When you let go.
A kiss from the 
Moon
Will last you
Forever.
Never forget
Her cool white 
Beams.
Never forget
Her beautiful
Face.




















With

Flying high
And Falling 
Deep,
The sweetest
Excitement from one enthusiastic
Hyper-real glance.
Firecracker
Eyes and
A firecracker
Smile
Could easily destroy
Anything with one
Mighty fast blow.
A thousand birds
On a wire,
All singing the same
Song in my pounding
Head.
Every one speaks a different
Chirp, and I smile
As the last blood 
Drips from their toes.
Then they fly away,
And the darkness returns.




























In a Month   5-1-95

The revolution,
A strange and twisted
Melody that only 
We can spin.
Kiss them all 
And live forever
Alone in us and free.
To be with you
And one together
Hiding from the midnight eyes.
Their horrible claws 
Will never reach us,
Their blackened throats will
Never speak.
But then it 
Comes and sweeps 
You away.
Our beautiful world is shattered
And torn around our
Lifeless forms.
It pulls your roots;
They snap in pain.
I stand there staring into
The nothing around me, 
Unaware of what is happening.
The world is ending,
Forever is now,
And you leave me.
























(Please)love me     5-3-95

Beautiful 
Forgotten
Wasteland dream song.
Never thought I'd
Remember once the night 
Rose.
Never knew the 
Logic comes and 
Goes.
It pulls still stronger
As I turn away.
I'm held there longer
As I try to let go.
No! 
Never come again.
Wait!
Never got a dime for 
Every time I forgot to say
I love you.
Never got a liberated
Fist in the mouth.
Thinking once again
About nothing that 
Was still everything in 
My sterling world,
I spin and fade
Like a summer shadow
In the absence
Of you.
























Nailed   5-10-95

Shadow light gloom
And falling figures
Spin and shatter
A closing visionary
Curse.
The blue in the 
River churns and twisted
Dried my eyes with
Tomorrow's heart.
A feeling of grief
And a head full of 
Screaming the heat
From the ice is forever
To bear.
Tomorrow is over
Before I can fall
Tomorrow forever
It pounds at us still,
Lightly taking.(away)
If only the light 
Would fade to sea
And all would be 
Complete in a secret
Far off place.
Perfection was there
But blindness took hold.
I missed the only tide
Out of misery that
Can't be thrashed.
I will never seem
To understand.




Found   5-24-95

Catch me now, there's little time
I'm falling.
Feed me lies and pull me through
Afterwards,
I know you, the one who can see.
Close my
Eyes and tell me a story, soundless
Whispers
Always can charm.  A ghost in the
Closet is
Lonely at best, but it will smile if
You give
It a key.  I wish once again for
A simple
Hand to lift me from my humbly
Spoken
Thoughtless darkness.
Okay so
I lied.  But help me, take me, hold
Me anyway.




		6-15-95

The sun pounds
Down from above.
Alone in a garden
With beautiful music.
Violins
And bongos
Sing me to sleep.
Sleep
Oh, beautiful
Sleep,
To grasp you 
Once again,
To embrace you 
In all your beauty.
The scream
In my head
Just won't let
Me anymore.
I loved you once,
I have not forgotten.
The music still
Swells from
Far away
Tears.




























Gone Blank

Blue rain clouds
These broken eyes.
Darkness shrouds
A hollow scream.
Crushing grasp
Of ancient listen
To my head,
It's lost it's name.
You seem to say
That you're alone again
You seem to think that 
I have gone.
I stand there softly
Meekly breathing
Watching as your
Dreams unfold.
You seem to see
As if right through me
Me, to you, is just
Not there.
Leaving once is not 
Enough, but 
Loving twice is 
Losing ground.
Turn your face
Don't watch me fall
You cry in the corner
I stare at the wall.
























Ice Dreams

You glide above an
Alien Landscape,
The last one alive 
in a world that seems dead.
Steam shapes shift from the 
Creek in the meadow,
Air itself sparkles
And breaks when you speak.
The trees all bend down
As you burst from the river,
the ice shatters sharply,
the wind steals your pain.
Snow blankets the ground
with glimmering white,
Lonely is light when
Night takes the Day.
Every star present
in blackness above,
Their shimmer is mirrored
in coldness below.
Moon light so clear you
can ride in its eye,
Everything held in 
a painful silence,
Locked in the mist 
of a frozen sky.




























Spring Rain    2-7-96

Nothing sounds
like rooftop
Water
Pouring down the 
Window pane,
Feeding the season
as warmth rises
Under sleeping fields
And pushes up between 
Her toes.
The wind,
Fresh
from far away
carries the 
song and
the pounding drums of
eyes opening and streams bubbling,
and even the
Trees crack as they
Stretch open their 
gigantic arms to 
greet her.
She is the one 
in the sky,
Changing the world,
Driving the clouds,
And pounding spring rain
into the dirt.
--------
The other
Darker,
Sweeter,
Wrapped in the mystery
of forgiving night,
So beautiful
So cold
buried in the blackest sand 
of the forgotten ceiling
Her pale light twisting, 
Turning, and slipping through
At last.
The Moon comes 
again
To darken the sky
and steals me away 
from the cool 
spring rain.
			








Forest for the Trees
5-19-96

She has become just
a voice in my head,
a face in a dream,
There in essence
but not in body.
I long for her touch
And I turn to you,
My friends.
My friends:
I'm falling
catch me in your
Sacred boughs,
cradle me from the
flames that destroy you.
I long for your 
green-cool light.
Trees that have 
Lived forever,
You die today,
leaving behind
one final seed.
It laughs and cries
in promise and tragedy.
I pray for you
to take me back 
to a day when
the forests will
live again
