fall fall first look down
see me sipping a dark drink there
see the fields around me
smoke distant, with fire even closer

I saw an old man there, beneath it all
under tons of ocean water
smothered with piles of yellow salt
still smiling, after all these years
a salor without his sails, 
(sails now rotted and
eaten by a few dozen fish).

Improbable though it may seem
what flies is not always what falls this far
(this lowdown broken from-the-heart).

When we ask what poetry should be
we are really imagining our own failures,
prescribing this sour medicine,
filling holes with holes.

I once swam six miles deep,
but I was the only one down there.

Ask the swimmer:
"How does swimming really solve anything?"
Though water surrounds us all,
though we swim through these stale basins,
lonely isn't as bad as dead.

Sinking down, watching
cities on blue cliffs float upward,
sipping miles of finished air
through a tube from a tank
on the surface.

Sink colder as
cities on blue cliffs float upward,
sipping miles of 
finished air through 
a tube from a tank
on the surface.

I saw an old man there, beneath it all
under tons of ocean water
smothered with piles of yellow salt
still smiling, after all these years
(a sailor without his sails).

we are imagining our own failures,
prescribing this sour medicine,
filling holes with holes.

I once swam six miles deep,
but I was the only one down there.

Ask the swimmer:
"How does swimming solve anything?"
Though cold thickness surrounds us
as we swim through these stale basins,
lonely is better than dead.
