sadness 1

it must be rain
this time
not blue but black
or gold.
gold sounds lonely
crazy angry at the world
sopping wet
and 

get out,
strange sounds,
broken music,
too weird for tonight,
too bright for the purple
clouds that cover everything.
filter through like
black water,
a thin vine of shiver.


sadness 2

voices are strange
through walls
from far off rooms.
light is weak 
through bars
under blankets.

windows are there to help
to filter the sun
to reflect the wind,
protecting stale breath
from the cold outside wilderness.



sadness 3

get out,
strange sounds,
broken music from ages past,
too weird for tonight,
too bright for the purple
clounds that cover everything,
filtering through like
black water,
a thin vine of shiver.



stillness 1






hold



lifted up above
tossing wildly
stare me down.
in touch but listening
for words to spill life
for breath to tear 
the myth in two.
let the water fill the space
welcome pounds of lead
into your heart.
