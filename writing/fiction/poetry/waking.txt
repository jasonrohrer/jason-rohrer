[Sunday March 3, 2002]

far away there is a fluttering sound
faint but persistant
silver as it rolls through my ear

and tickles my mind to wake
with mercury drops slippering through, right to left.
    [left ear muffled by pillow]

before i open my eyes,
i dream that they have opened
to see your eyes fluttering
and gazing back.

as my real eyes open,
you fade into a bookshelf
of dusty volumes, each jealous of my dream.
