<H1>The Debt Money Meme</H1>

A story seems to be spreading through our society about how money is created.
The story itself, that banks create money by issuing loans, is true, but the analysis that usually accompanies the story is flawed.<BR>
<BR>
Money systems are quite complicated and confusing, so the analysis in question can be quite alluring.
I myself was under its spell for a few years.
I recently woke up.

<H2>The Money Creation Story</H2>

The story usually goes something like this:<BR>
<BR>

<CENTER><TABLE WIDTH=75% CELLPADDING=7><TR><TD BGCOLOR=#EEEEEE>

Did you ever think about where money comes from?<BR>
<BR>
There is obviously more money around than ever before, so the supply has certainly been growing.
But who is injecting new dollars into the system?
Your first guess might be "the government," but this guess would be wrong.
Banks, not governments, create money, and they do it every time they make a loan.<BR>
<BR>
The process can best be explained by a simple example.<BR>
<BR>
Imagine two people, Alice and Bob, and suppose that Alice starts out with $100, while Bob starts out with no money.
Alice puts her $100 into a bank account.<BR>
<BR>
The bank opperates according to fractional reserve principles:  it must keep a certain fraction of Alice's deposit on hand, though it is free to loan out the rest.
In the US, the minimum reserve ratio for a bank is between zero and ten percent, depending on the size of the bank (see the <A HREF="http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/reservereq.htm">Federal Reserve</A> for more information).<BR>
<BR>
To be conservative, we can set our example bank's reserve ratio at 10%.
Thus, the bank can loan out $90 and must keep $10 of Alice's deposit in reserve.<BR>
<BR>
Now suppose Bob wants to take out a loan for $90.
The bank has enough money to do this, so it lends Bob what he needs.
Now suppose Bob simply takes his $90 and deposits it in his own account at the same bank.
Suddenly, the bank has a total of $190 on deposit ($100 from Alice and $90 from Bob).
According to fractional reserve principles, the bank is free to loan out $81 of Bob's deposit---it must keep $9, or 10% of $90, in reseve.<BR>
<BR>
Notice the important point here:  the bank took a deposit of $100 and turned it into $190.  <I>The bank created money</I>.
This process is real, and it is described in any mainstream economics textbook.  For example, see page 492 of <I>Economics</I> by Samuelson and Nordhaus (published by McGraw-Hill).<BR>
<BR>
Now, what happens when it comes time for Bob to pay back his loan?
There is one other factor here that we have not mentioned yet:  interest.
Bob cannot satisfy his debt just by paying the bank $90, he must pay $90 plus interest.
To keep the example simple, suppose the interest payment is set at $5 for a one year loan, so Bob must repay the bank $95 at the end of the year (this would be an interest rate of 5.55% per year).
Thus, Bob owes the bank $95, but he only has $90 in his account. 
</TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER>
<BR>

That is the story, and so far, it does not contain any flaws.
Now comes the analysis, which usually goes something like this:<BR>
<BR>

<CENTER><TABLE WIDTH=75% CELLPADDING=7><TR><TD BGCOLOR=#EEEEEE>
But how can Bob possibly pay $95?
He can certainly pay back the $90 principal, but where will the extra $5 come from?
You can see that Bob is stuck:  The bank has expanded the money pool to $190 through a loan, but it is asking for an additional $5 that is not part of that pool.
Thus, Bob can only pay back the interest if extra money is created, and money is only created through loans.
Bob must take out another loan to pay back his first loan.<BR>
<BR>
For example, the bank has a total of $190, with $90 of that out on loan.
That means that the bank can loan out an additional $81, so it can certainly loan Bob the $5 that he needs.
Of course, Bob will eventually need to pay back this $5 plus interest, which will require yet another loan.<BR>
<BR>
Because of the simplicity of this example, we see Bob taking out a new loan to pay back his previous loan.
Bob would noticed the futility of his efforts after a few of these cycles.
In the real world, where the situation is more complex, we don't have one person taking out loan after loan, but instead have someone else in the system, say Eve, taking out a loan, and using that loan to pay Bob.
With that payment, Bob can pay back his loan, though Eve will still need to find a way to pay back her loan eventually.<BR>
<BR>
The point is that all money is created as <I>debt money</I> which must be repaid with interest that does not exist yet.
That interest money can only be generated through more loans.<BR>
<BR>
Thus, our money system dooms us to eternal debt which we can never collectively repay. 
</TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER>

<BR>

My claim is that this analysis and conclusion are flawed.
I will point out this flaw below.
However, I first want to emphasize that I am not just setting up a straw man so I can knock it down.
The above analysis is presented time and time again by critics of our money system.
For example, read the fabel version of this story as presented in <A HREF="http://www.prolognet.qc.ca/clyde/money.htm">The Money Myth Exploded</A>.
As another example, see <A HREF="http://landru.i-link-2.net/monques/belief3.html">Common Beliefs About Money</A>.
A very succinct example can be found in the following quote, which was taken from <A HREF="http://socialwork.arts.unsw.edu.au/tsw/D04DebtIntrestMoney.html">Debts, Interest, and Money</A>:<BR><BR>
<CENTER><TABLE WIDTH=75% CELLPADDING=7><TR><TD BGCOLOR=#EEEEEE>

"Another absurd implication of the present system is that it makes it totally and increasingly impossible for debt ever to be paid off. If someone borrows $100 at 10% interest then at the end of the year that person is expected to pay back $110. Now lets say that in one year Australians borrow $10 billion at an average 10% interest, meaning that at the end of the year they are expected to pay back $11 billion. Where will they get the extra $1 billion? If they got it from the money previously in existence, then over time the money in circulation would be slowly depleted as some of it is taken each year to pay the interest falling due, as more has to be paid back than was borrowed. The point is that the additional money to pay the interest was not created when the loan was created. Where does it come from? It comes from new loans. So as time goes by Australians can only pay the interest due to banks by borrowing more from the banks. So at any one point in time it is impossible to pay off all debt, and over time debt must increase.<BR>
<BR>
"What happens in the long run? The answer seems to be that there is a crash, a major depression in which many debts can't be paid and are written off, while many firms and individuals go bankrupt, at great cost to large numbers of people."</I> <!-- for emacs " -->

<H2>The Flaw</H2>
The above analyses sound pretty convincing, so where do they go wrong?
They never talk about where the interest payments are actually going.
When Bob pays $5 of interest on his loan to the bank, the bank does not simply swallow that $5 into a black hole.
Instead, it takes that $5 as profit and spends it.<BR>
<BR>
For example, the bank might pay employees with it, buy office supplies, or build a new branch.
What happens when the bank spends the interest money in this way?
The money goes back out into public circulation, and it might even circulate back through the bank to cover someone else's interest payment.
Thus, a particular dollar, if it cycles through the bank over and over, can be used to pay an infinite amount of interest.<BR>
<BR>
Returning to our simple example, suppose Bob first pays off the principal of $90 and then plans to pay back the $5 in a separate payment, all before the one year deadline passes.
Where can Bob get $5 at this point?
Well, Alice has $100 in her account (Bob, we should note, is back to $0), and Bob might do some work for Alice.
Suppose that he gets paid only $1 for his work.
He can pay $1 of interest to the bank and reduce his debt to $4.
But what does the bank do with that $1?
Suppose that Alice is a paper maker, and the bank needs to buy paper for its office.
It buys $1 worth of paper from Alice, bringing her balance up from $99 to $100.<BR>
<BR>
Bob might then do more work for Alice, earning another dollar and paying the bank, and the bank might again buy $1 worth of paper from Alice.
This cycle can continue until Bob pays back all $5 of the interest.<BR>
<BR>
As the final step in the cycle, the bank might buy $1 worth of paper from Alice, bringing her balance back up to $100.
At this point, we are back to exactly where we started.
No looming debt that Bob and friends will never pay off.
No money created that did not initially exist.<BR>
<BR>
Yes, money was created temporarily when the bank loaned Bob $90, but that money was destroyed when Bob payed back his loan.
Furthermore, a single dollar of Alice's original deposit was cycled through the bank over and over to pay off Bob's interest.
Notice that, in exchange for lending Bob $90, the bank got $5 worth of paper from Alice.
This is the bank's payment, in the form of goods that it needs, for the risk inherent in loaning Bob money.
In exchange for her paper, Alice got work out of Bob, and in exchange for his work, Bob got to borrow $90 for a year.
Thus, we have a perfectly ordinary trade triangle.

<H2>The Kernel of the Flaw</H2>
So, where is that loathsome "eternal debt" lurking after all?
I will point out, again, that whenver this money creation story is told, details about what the bank does with the interest are omitted.
Through this incomplete accouting, we might conclude that additional loans must be taken out to pay off existing debt.
But once we include all of the money into our accounting, we can see that this is not the case:  even in our simple example, Bob was able to pay back his loan without a single additional loan being created.<BR>
<BR>
Of course, we still have a debt-based money system, in that all money created through loans eventually needs to be paid back.
This is not ideal for many reasons, but one of these reasons <I>is not</I> that we will have eternal debt and interest that we can never repay.

<H2>Is All Money Debt-based?</H2>

Even if every single penny in circulation was created through a loan that must be paid back, it would be possible for us to pay back all loans, including interest.
Of course, such a mass-scale payback would result in everyone in the system ending up with a bank balance of $0.<BR>
<BR>
In reality, some of the money in circulation was created without loans.
For example, the U.S. Treasury issued <A HREF="http://www.federalreserve.gov/generalinfo/faq/faqcur.htm#3">U.S. Notes</A> between 1862 and 1961 by spending, not loaning, them into existence.
The money created in the form of U.S. Notes (which have now mostly been retired from circulation in exchange for Federal Reserve Notes) never needs to be paid back.<BR>
<BR>
In fact, a <I>purely</I> fractional reserve system depends on at least some money existing before loans are made.
The first banks in such a system cannot make any loans until they have some deposites on hand.
Thus, the claim that all money is created through loans in a pure fractional reserve system is false:  a bank cannot legally loan unless it already has money on deposite.
This point is demonstrated by our simple example with Alice and Bob.
Notice that Alice started out with $100.
If both she and Bob started out with $0, the bank would never have been able to loan Bob $90---it would have never been able to create money if no money existed in the first place.<BR>
<BR>
However, our money system is <I>not</I> based purely on fractional reserve banking.
The Federal Reserve itself is not subject to any fractional reserve regulations.
Thus, the Fed can loan as much money as needed by simply creating it.
In fact, the Fed does loan money to member banks to keep their reserve ratios high enough.
In other words, if a bank suddenly has too many loans compared to its deposites, it borrows money from the Fed to increase its reserves and meet reserve requirements.<BR>
<BR>
So, in our system, it is possible for all money to be debt-based:  the first banks in the system could simply borrow from the Fed before making their first money-creating loans.<BR>
<BR>
However, our money system long predates the Fed, which was established in 1913, and there is certainly <I>some</I> money in circulation that was not created through loans (for example, the U.S. Notes mentioned earlier). 
So, we are in better shape, thanks to our turbulent money history, than we would be if our money was 100% debt-based from the start.<BR>
<BR>
If all loans were paid off, we would not all end up with $0 bank balances.
Of course, such a massive pay-off would result in massive deflation and grand-scale economic strife.
But just because we seem stuck to it does not mean that debt-based money is ideal:  there are <A HREF="alternativesToDebtMoney.html">alternatives</A>.
