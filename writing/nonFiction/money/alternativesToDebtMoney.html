<H1>Alternatives to Debt-based Money</H1>

We may seem stuck with it, but that does not mean that <A HREF="debtMoneyMeme.html">debt-based money creation</A> is ideal.
Of course, all money implicitly represents debt:  whoever accepts money is in debt to whoever holds it.
If I am selling bread in exchange for money, I essentially "owe" Alice a loaf of bread when she walks into my shop with money.
After I get the money, someone else who will accept it from me owes me some goods or services.<BR>
<BR>
Yes, all money implies a debt, but it does not necessarily need to be <I>created</I> in the shadow of a debt.
In other words, money can either be loaned into existence, which is what we do now, or spent into existence.<BR>
<BR>
If it is loaned into existence, it must eventually be repaid back to the money creator.
On the other hand, if it is spent into existence, the money creator agrees to accept it as payment in the future.
Thus, spending-created money represents a debt <I>of</I> the money creator, whereas loan-created money represents a debt <I>to</I> the money creator.<BR>
<BR>
For example, if I bake bread, I can spend "bread dollars" into existence, and I would agree to accept them in exchange for my bread in the future.
I could give Alice bread dollars in exchange for her fixing my car, and she could redeem them for my bread later or pay other people with them in exchange for something else.<BR>
<BR> 
On the other hand, I could create some dollars and loan them to Eve, who would promise to pay me back with interest.
Even if these particular dollars flowed back through me during the course of other activities, Eve's loan would not be paid back until she gave me dollars (or equivalent goods or services) back in exchange for nothing.
I gave her dollars in exchange for nothing, and she eventually gives dollars back in exchange for nothing;  in addition, she pays me interest in exchange for the loan.<BR>
<BR>
The inherent value of the "bread dollars" is obvious:  they can always be exchanged for bread.
Lots of people want bread, and those who do not are certainly only a few economic trasactions away from someone who does.
Where does the inherent value of the loaned dollars come from?
The value is in their ability to pay back the loan.
No one would accept such dollars as payment from Alice unless lots of other people were also in debt to me---enough people so that everyone was again only a few economic transactions away from one of my debtors.<BR>
<BR>
The point about inherent value can be illustrated with a few examples.<BR>
<BR>
First, imagine that I bake terrible bread that nobody likes.
If I try to spend bread dollars into circulation, who would accept them from me?
Suppose I tried to spend them in exchange for car repairs from Alice.
She would first think about whether she wants any bread from me---she certainly does not, so my bread dollars have no direct value to her.
Next she would think about whether other people might be willing to accept my bread dollars---if so, then they are of value to Alice, since she will have places to spend them.
Of course, since nobody likes my bread, Alice will have no place to spend my bread dollars.
Thus, these dollars have no direct <EM>or</EM> indirect value to Alice, so she will refuse to accept them in exchange for car repairs.
On the other hand, if I bake good bread that most people want, Alice would be likely to accept my bread dollars even if she personally had no desire for my bread.<BR>
<BR>
Now, consider an example where I am loaning money into existence.
I create money and lend it to Eve, and she agrees to pay me back with interest.
Who would be willing to accept these "loan dollars" in payment from Eve?
Anyone who was in debt to me would want these loan dollars, since they could use them to pay me back.
Loan dollars are thus directly valuable to my debtors.
In addition, if many people were in debt to me, there would be plenty of places to spend my loan dollars, so they would be indirectly valuable to most people.
On the other hand, if only Eve is in debt to me, who would be willing to accept payment in my loan dollars?
In fact, the more people that are in debt to me, the more valuable my loan dollars become.
Furthermore, as more people become in debt to me, more people will want to borrow these loan dollars from me, since they will become a valuable "type" of money to borrow.<BR>
<BR>  

Though one of my examples includes money "backed" by bread, the point is not about the difference between "backed" money and "fiat" money.
The point is about the money's relationship to the money creator.
In fact, we could see both example moneys as being backed:  one is backed by my bread, while the other is backed by the ability to pay back a loan to me.

<H2>Distrust of Government Spending</H2>

For some reason, we generally believe that spending money into existence does not work well.
We worry about massive inflation due to over-spending by the money creator.<BR>
<BR>
For example, a government might create money and spend it into existence to pay for various activities, and it would also agree to accept this money as payment for taxes.
The problem, of course, is effectively limiting how much money the government spends into creation.<BR>
<BR>

Legends about <A HREF="http://www.joelscoins.com/exhibger2.htm">Germany's massive inflation</A> in the 1920s loom in our collective consciousness.
Anecdotes about Germany, with its wheelbarrows full of money that were used to buy groceries, are resurrected in response to any spend-to-create money proposal.<BR>
<BR>

Without a limit, the danger of massive inflation is certainly real, though it seems that proper, strict regulation could make it work.
The lessons we learned from the inflation epidemics should be taken to heart, but they should not scare us completely into acceptance of a debt-based money system.<BR>
<BR>

Of course, the problem with spending-created money runs a bit deeper than just an issue of distrusting government.
Take the example of a bread baker who issues "bread dollars."
What is to stop me as a baker from issuing many more bread dollars than I can ever accept back in exchange for bread?
If I became overtaken by greed, I could amass an enormous collection of wealth by purchasing goods and services from others in exchange for bread dollars, which I might be printing just as fast as I can.
I might issue millions of "loaves" worth of these bread dollars, and I might never be able to bake that many loaves in my entire lifetime.<BR>
<BR>
The core problem is that the entity which is spending money into existence, if unchecked, can buy as much as it wants whenever it wants.
It may be impossible for this spender to ever repay society for all that it consumes.<BR>
<BR>
Similar problems lurk in a loan-created money system.
Many people, not just a single entity, can borrow as much money as they want and never fully pay it back.
Thus, we have large numbers of people who are gaining wealth "for free" without repaying society---many people carry massive debts into their graves.
In my view, it is much harder to keep everyone in check than it is to keep a single money creator in check.<BR>
<BR>
There is a check system in place in our loan system, however, and that is our credit reporting system.
People who have failed to pay back old debts on time are denied new loans.
A similar system naturally emerges in a spending-created money system through the inflation and money distrust that accompanies over-zealous spending.<BR>
<BR>
If I as a baker spend too many bread dollars, people will notice my activities and stop accepting bread dollars as payment from me.
If I am bound by my agreement to accept bread dollars back in exchange for bread, I will quickly start accumulating bread dollars (since I am receiving them in exchange for bread, but no one is accepting them from me any longer).
Thus, the distrust of my over-spending will act to curb the inflation that my spending caused, since bread dollars will drop out of circulation as I collect them.<BR>
<BR>
These natural mechanisms would certainly work on a small scale, but we do not need to rely on them for our nation-wide money system.
Proper legislation, with money creation caps, can curb government spending.    

<H2>Trust of Government Debt</H2>

Somehow, the threat of debt is supposed to scare the government away from spending more than it takes in.
If the government could print money, the reasoning goes, we would be in trouble, but if we force the government to borrow money at interest, we will be safe.<BR>
<BR>
Of course, the spiraling national debt and the perpetual yearly defecits betray the flaws in this reasoning.
Debt does not scare government any more than inflation.
The only way to reign in the government is through proper legislation.


<H2>Fundamental Problems with Debt-based Money</H2>

Issues of government control aside, the problems associated with debt-based money cut deeply into society.
At the core of these problems is the general personal hope and anticipation of becoming individually debt-free, but the fundamental impossibility of debt-freedom on a mass scale.
How can all people pull themselves permanently out of debt if most money in circulation only exists in the shadow of loans that must be paid back?
Despite this impossibility, pamplets, TV ads, and offers of free phone consultation goad the masses toward the <A HREF="http://www.getdebtfree.com/">illusory goal of debt-freedom</A>.<BR>
<BR>
Even a closed system, with a fixed supply of non-debt money, would be better than the system we have now, at least in terms of the mere <I>possibility</I> of everyone being out of debt without a drastic reduction in the net money supply.
Of course, in such a system, yearly savings on the part of every player would be impossible:  you can only save a bit of money this year if someone else lost a bit this year.<BR>
<BR>

FIXME:  is it true that savings is impossible?  Saved money is not in circulation, so it doesn't add to inflation as much as circulating money.  As long as people spend their savings in a slow trickle (e.g., when they get old), we might have true savings.
If all people really produce more than they consume, we should actually get a surplus of goods that we might "save" for the future.
Think about this more.<BR>
<BR> 

Furthermore, yearly savings across the board (through the creation of money) would result in inflation:  when everyone has more money, year by year, money becomes less valuable.
Thus, savings numbers may go up, but the true values in the accounts will remain constant.
Mass-scale savings, as a goal, is therefore fundamentally impossible.<BR>
<BR>
So what is the goal?<BR>
<BR>
We should realize that concerns about debt are more cultural than economic.
Since mass-scale debt pay-back in our debt-money system would result in massive deflation, quality of life would not change much as a result.
In other words, with no debts and therefore less money in cirulation, prices and wages would drop.
We would all earn less money, and goods would cost less.
In addition, almost all of our money would be spent directly on goods instead of part of it on goods and part of it on debt and interest payback.<BR>
<BR>
Also, switching from loan-created money to money created by government spending would also result in no net quality-of-life change.
However, this spending-created money could balance the deflation caused by mass-scale debt payback.<BR>
<BR>
Though there might be no fundamental lifestyle improvements, there would be a cultural and mental change accompanying debt-freedom.
For whatever reason, debt tends to weigh people down psychologically, trapping them in a bog of hopelessness.
In fact, it may even weigh them down physically, since they cannot just "pick up and leave" on a whim if they have outstanding debts.<BR>
<BR>
Furthermore, debt-freedom would mean the extinction of a particular career:  bankers would be out of a job.
We can debate the positives and negatives of this particular career loss.
However, I will point out that it is a bit odd that a small group of people can amass so much wealth just by fiddling with (or "managing") other people's money.
And unfortunately for the bankers, they do not have many allys except for other bankers:  almost everyone owes bankers money, so widespread resent is certainly brewing.
