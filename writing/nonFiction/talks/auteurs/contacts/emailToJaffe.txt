"One of the most emotional video games I've ever played is a Flash game called 'Passage.'"   --(you back in Jan 2008)


Greetings!  I'm Jason Rohrer, the guy who made Passage... and Gravitation... and 7 game sketches for The Escapist this year.  I'm an "award-winning" indie game designer, blah blah blah.

Sorry to write to you on YouTube....


I'm giving an invited talk at Project Horseshoe in Austin next month (a weekend-long think tank on game design, up in the mountains, for the best-and-brightest in the industry).

My talk is called:  "The Non-Rise of the Video Game Auteur."

As research for this talk, I'm interviewing 3 people.  So far, I've chatted with a Hollywood filmmaker, an indie game design genius... and I'm hoping you'd be willing to be the 3rd (as an auteur working in the game industry).

30 minutes max, by phone.  About your experience as an auteur, about why your name's not on the front (or back?) of the box.   About green-lighting, creative control, and all that stuff.  About autuer hierarchy vs. communal team collaboration.

My chat with the filmmaker was really eye-opening... here's this young-ish, no-name guy who made one quirky Sundance film, and he's handed 10 million by the studio that picked him up to make whatever movie he wants to make next (after the initial green-lighting, he has final cut rights---i.e., complete creative control).


Okay... so that's my pitch.  I know you're busy.... so am I!  I promise I won't waste your time.

If you're up for a 30-minute chat by phone, please email me back directly (I don't check my youtube account much):
