Beyond Single Player:
Hunting for an Artistic Niche

Abstract

How can video games reach the great artistic heights of other mediums like film, novels, paintings, and music?  Each of these mediums supports artistic expression in its own, unique way, and we need to find games' expressive niche.  Aping movies with cut scenes just reinforces the "wannabe" status of games.

Creators in the burgeoning indie "art game" scene have recently shined light on an expressive tool that is unique to our medium:  game mechanics.  By crafting games that explore the human condition at the gameplay level, these proceduralist art game designers have made expressive and moving works that could only exist as games.  Are meaningful game mechanics the key to games' legitimacy?

What about Go, an ancient folk game revered for its simple mechanics and extraordinary, emergent depth?  Though it's not "about" anything in particular, Go purportedly reveals deep mysteries about the nature of our universe.  Is Go our /Ulysses/, our greatest and most profound work?  Why don't these so-called "art games"---or any modern video games, for that matter---hold a candle to Go in terms of gameplay depth?

If gameplay is our artistic bread-and-butter, why do we cling so fiercely to the single-player branch of the design tree?  Are we mimicking other art-capable mediums, which are all fundamentally single-viewer?  Have we unwittingly corded ourselves off in the shallow end of the gameplay pool? 

To push games forward artistically, we may need to return to the medium's pre-digital roots:  multiple players seated around a game and using it as an interface for intellectual communion.
