\begin{itemize}

\item Motivation [Slide:  Shia Laboeuf]

\item Found this during my own productivity crisis, when I was researching productivity techniques.

\item Seen as a joke.  Shia playing a character

\item Just Do It is an instantaneous action, not a process.

\item Difference between momentary motivation and long haul productivity.

\item As indies, this may be the single most important thing to master.

\item By indie, I mean career indie.

\item Being motivated to make one game is hard enough.

\item Long haul even harder

\item Indies have no bosses and are entirely self-supervising and self-motivating.

\item Failing doesn't even mean getting fired.  

\item We just quietly fail ourselves.

\item I thought I had mastered long haul, until I was put to the test, and it was clear that I absolutely hadn't.

\item First, I'll start with my story [Slide:  my game history].

\item A story that leads eventually to an absolute productivity breakdown.
