Jason Rohrer is an independent game artist, programmer, and critic.  With game designs that explore complex and subtle aspects of the human condition, his work has bolstered the acceptance of games as a serious art form.  Rohrer's games have been shown at festivals and art exhibitions in Park City, Toronto, Montreal, and Lleida, Spain.  His 2007 release, _Passage_, received widespread critical and industry acclaim, with _God of War_ creator David Jaffe calling _Passage_ "one of the most emotional video games I've ever played."  Parallel with his design efforts, Rohrer's review and interview site _Arthouse Games_ has served as the lone hub of artgame criticism since 2006.  Rohrer lives with his spouse and two children in the rural town of Potsdam, New York, where they pursue a simple, frugal lifestyle.
