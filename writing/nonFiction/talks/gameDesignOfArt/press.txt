Video Game Design Lecture at Clarkson University

"The Game Design of Art" a Presentation by Jason Rohrer
Clarkson University
7:30pm on Thursday, February 7th in CAMP 176
Event is Free

Jason Rohrer, a video game designer living in Potsdam, will present his observations from the front lines of the "games as art" debate, with the goal of inspiring game developers, artists and players alike to change their perceptions of games as a capable art form.

Mr. Rohrer's work has continued to change the definition of video games, pushing the medium toward new frontiers by exploring subtle aspects of the human condition.  His most recent release, "Passage," has seen 60,000 downloads in its first two months and has been hailed as revolutionary by dozens of journalists:

"The 'games as art' debate is officially over." -- Reverend Anthony, Destructoid.com

"One of the most emotional video games I've ever played."  - David Jaffe, "God of War" creator.
