In his lecture "The Game Design of Art," Jason Rohrer will present his observations from the front lines of the "games as art" debate.  The fundamental question for Rohrer is not "Can games be art?", but instead, "How can we make art with our games?"  Through comparison with film and critical analysis of several example artgames, the talk will explore one possible creative route:  using game mechanics as metaphor.
