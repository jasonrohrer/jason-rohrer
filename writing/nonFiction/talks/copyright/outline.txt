What is copyright?
--Constitution  (SLIDE 1)
--Initial incarnation (14 years, +14 year renewal)   (SLIDE 3)

History of copyright
--Graph showing extensions   (SLIDE 4)
  1787  Power granted, but not used (0 years of protection)
  1790  14 + 14 year renewal
  1831  28 + 14 year renewal
  1909  28 + 28 year renewal
  1976  75 years  (or life of author +50)
  1998  95 years  (or life of authoer +70)


--Line shows Mickey's age
  --Created in 1928 (Plane Crazy)  (SLIDE 4b)
  --56 Years of copyright protection (28 years, plus 28 year renewal) (SLIDE 4)
  --Scheduled for public domain in 1984
  --Copyright protection extended to 75 years in 1976
  --Mickey now slated for public domain in 2003
  --Copyright protection extended to 95 years in 1998
  --New public domain birthday:  2023

So, Disney wants to maintain control of Mickey forever (it would be in their
best interest, of course---only natural).

But can they really control Mickey?

--Thomas Jefferson quote  (SLIDE 2) 

--Home taping (mix tapes, full album dubs, etc.)
--New threat:  digital home taping (lossless) (DAT 1987)
--Audio home recording act (blank media taxes)  (SLIDE 5)
  --In exchange, consumers cannot be sued for making copies at home.



Pre-Internet Analysis:
--Original purpose of copyright:  to ensure that creator of a work is the 
  only one who can reap commercial benefit from the work (for a limited time)

--Easy to enforce this version of copyright, especially in the pre-Internet
  world.  How many in the class have their own:  printing press?  Vinyl 
  stamping machine for making records?  Radio station?  TV station?

--Only large corporations had the capital needed to copy works on a mass scale,
  so copyright really just protected corporations from each other.

--Copying at home started to become more viable (cassette dubbing, DAT)

--How many in class have ever made a mix tape?

--Corporations began pushing to apply copyright against non-commercial, private
  copying.



The Internet:
--How many in class have their own:  website?  blog?  MySpace page?  YouTube 
  videos?  How many have ever used p2p software like KaZaA, LimeWire, or 
  Morpheus?

--Internet puts mass communication in the hands of "everyone," and with mass
  communication comes the ability to copy and distribute copyrighted works
  on a mass scale.

--Almost all "illegal" copying on the internet is non-commercial.

--A strong argument can be made that copyright was never intended to limit
  non-commercial, private copying.

--Works that should certainly be in the public domain now, such as Mickey 
  Mouse, may never become public.  Almost all the folks who saw Plane Crazy
  as children are dead now.  We're being denied access to our own cultural
  heritage.

--We have the tools.  Let's revolt.  (SLIDE 6)


--History of online copying:

  --Generation 0:  FTP and web sites  1991--? (draw picture)
  --Mostly trading software
  --MP3 (suddenly, music is fair game)
  --RIAA:  shut them all down (cease-and-desist letters to hosting companies)
  
  --Generation 1:  Napster  (1999)
  --Central indexing for searches, decentralized storage (draw picture)
  --Less reliable and scalable than FTP/Web
  --The first true boom in online music sharing
  --RIAA:  shut the index (Napster) down  (2001)

  --Generation 2:  Gnutella (March 2000) (and then KaZaA, October 2000)
  --Decentralized storage *and* searches (draw picture)
  --Direct user-to-user file transfers
  --Slower and less reliable than central indexing
  --RIAA:  Can't shut down the index
  --RIAA:  sue the end users, one-by-one (September 2003)

  --Generation 3:  MUTE  (December 2003)
  --Anonymous, indirect searches and file transfers (draw picture)
  --Slower and less reliable than direct file transfers
  --RIAA:  ?
  --Downloaded by over 860,000 people (Still being downloaded by about 
    400 people per day)

--Lesson:  we can use technology to "route around" whatever obstacles the RIAA
  throws at us.

Notes and discussion:  

--Companies have largely been sued out of the p2p business (Napster,
  KaZaA, Morpheus, Grokster, etc.)

--Hard to make money off of decentralized technologies (no control-- e.g.,
  KaZaA Lite)

--Newest business ventures are centralized (Blogger, MySpace, YouTube).

--YouTube as a copyright nightmare
  
--Will pay-per-download services like iTunes replace p2p file sharing?
