"Game" and Other Four Letter Words

Video games have a cultural image problem that blocks them from being accepted as a serious artistic medium.  Defenders of the medium blame the image problem entirely on the close-mindedness of Roger Ebert and the rest of his oldster, Luddite buddies.  With time, say these defenders, games will ascend to take their natural place at the altar of high culture, once we pass the point where the cultural priests all grew up playing video games themselves.  But if we take an honest look at our medium, we must acknowledge that the root of the problem runs much deeper, leading right down to the heart of what our consumers, the gamers, demand and expect from video games.  Our image problem won't clear up unless we make a concerted effort from inside our medium to stop pandering to these demands.
