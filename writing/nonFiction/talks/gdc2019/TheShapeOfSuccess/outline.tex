\begin{itemize}

\item Talk is all about finanical results

\item Depending on lens, either impressive or mediocre.

\item Alternate title [Slide: funny title]

\item Some of you just getting started in career

\item Don't want to give false impression

\item Comparing 17th game to 19th game [Slide:  17 v 19]

\item Big picture (lifetime actually in the bank money) [Slide: big picture]

\item First time ever calculated this total

\item First reaction:  Wow.

\item Hold on.  Been doing this 15 years.  Made 19 games.  [Slide: 15 years]

\item No money for 6 years [Slide]

\item No money until 14th game [Slide]

\item Repeat that:  I made 13 games that didn't make money [Slide]

\item Expectation?  Making money on your first game [Slide]

\item Expect disappointment.

\item Your first game is awesome [Slide]

\item You're probably wrong.

\item You're a great game designer [Slide]

\item Talk to me in ten years.

\item Good money now?  Yes!  [Slide]

\item More than I could make in any other job. [Slide: last year]

\item But... [Slide: 3.5 years]

\item Per year [Slide:  ave per year]

\item Per game [Slide:  ave per game]

\item Could have made more over time with a job [Slide:  apple]

\item Long term project [Slide: long term]

\item Success takes time to build

\item Getting good at making games takes time

\item  Expect lots of failure

\item Don't give up.

\item Even after success, failure can come [Slide: game 18]

\item If just getting started, indiv. or small studio...

\item What should you do?

\item Most of you will over-scope.

\item Most of you will never ship.

\item If you do ship, no one will care.

\item Shipping an over-scoped game that fails, as your first game, will destroy you.

\item So, here's a plan for you [Slide:  Plan goals]

\item 2-year, 10-game plan [Slide]

\item Spend 1 week on first game. Ship it [slide]

\item Spend 2 weeks on second game.  Ship it [slide]

\item Spend 1 month each on your next 5 games.  Ship them all [slide]

\item So at this point, six months have past, and you've shipped 7 games [slide]

\item Spend 6 months each on your next 3 games.  Ship them all [slide]

\item After that, since you've learned to scope, and learned to ship, you're ready to take on bigger projects.

\item Compare your first two years to the ``normal'' first two years:

\item Normally, you'd barely ship one over-scoped game at the end of two years, and it would normally be a failure, and you'd be dead.

\item Instead, you've shipped 10 games during that same time, made a name for yourself along the way, and are well-positioned to work on and ship game 11 to a paying audience.

\item End of prologue [slide]
