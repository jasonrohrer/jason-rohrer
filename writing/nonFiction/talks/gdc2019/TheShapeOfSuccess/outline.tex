\begin{itemize}

\item Talk is all about finanical results

\item Depending on lens, either impressive or mediocre.

\item Alternate title [Slide: funny title]

\item Some of you just getting started in career

\item Don't want to give false impression

\item Comparing 17th game to 19th game [Slide:  17 v 19]

\item Big picture (lifetime actually in the bank money) [Slide: big picture]

\item First time ever calculated this total

\item First reaction:  Wow.

\item Hold on.  Been doing this 15 years.  Made 19 games.  [Slide: 15 years]

\item No money for 6 years [Slide]

\item No money until 14th game [Slide]

\item Repeat that:  I made 13 games that didn't make money [Slide]

\item Expectation?  Making money on your first game [Slide]

\item Expect disappointment.

\item Your first game is awesome [Slide]

\item You're probably wrong.

\item You're a great game designer [Slide]

\item Talk to me in ten years.

\item Good money now?  Yes!  [Slide]

\item More than I could make in any other job. [Slide: last year]

\item But... [Slide: 3.5 years]

\item Per year [Slide:  ave per year]

\item Per game [Slide:  ave per game]

\item Could have made more over time with a job [Slide:  apple]

\item Long term project [Slide: long term]

\item Success takes time to build

\item Getting good at making games takes time

\item  Expect lots of failure

\item Don't give up.

\item Even after success, failure can come [Slide: game 18]

\item If just getting started, indiv. or small studio...

\item What should you do?

\item Most of you will over-scope.

\item Most of you will never ship.

\item If you do ship, no one will care.

\item Shipping an over-scoped game that fails, as your first game, will destroy you.

\item So, here's a plan for you [Slide:  Plan goals]

\item 2-year, 10-game plan [Slide]

\item Spend 1 week on first game. Ship it [slide]

\item Spend 2 weeks on second game.  Ship it [slide]

\item Spend 1 month each on your next 5 games.  Ship them all [slide]

\item So at this point, six months have past, and you've shipped 7 games [slide]

\item Spend 6 months each on your next 3 games.  Ship them all [slide]

\item After that, since you've learned to scope, and learned to ship, you're ready to take on bigger projects.

\item Compare your first two years to the ``normal'' first two years:

\item Normally, you'd barely ship one over-scoped game at the end of two years, and it would normally be a failure, and you'd be dead.

\item Instead, you've shipped 10 games during that same time, made a name for yourself along the way, and are well-positioned to work on and ship game 11 to a paying audience.

\item End of prologue [slide]

\item Where did this indieapocalypse idea come from? [Slide: the word]

\item A string of publicly announced, high profile failures

\item From well-known devs.  [Slides:  Az, Wine, Scanner, Tacoma]

\item And 3.5 years into OHOL dev, this stuff made me nervous.

\item But somehow [Slide:  OHOL Steam]

\item And old game that's still making money [Slide:  Age and Players]

\item Luck?  [Slide]

\item But looking through SteamCharts, I'm finding some other paid games with even more players.

\item Ever heard of this?  [Slide:  Staxel]

\item Or this?  [Slide: vineland]

\item Going higher, what about this? [Slide: airport]

\item Or this? [Slide: Fish]

\item Maybe you've heard of some of these games [Slide: 25 game]

\item What about these games: 50 game]

\item Or these? [Slide: 100 game]

\item Or these? [Slide: 200 game]

\item All of these have MORE concurrent players than OHOL

\item So far, I've put 375 games up on the screen, but that's only a fraction.

\item Actually 1050 [Slide:  1050]

\item So there are TONS of success stories out there

\item Maybe more than ever before.

\item We just don't hear about them.

\item Still, a lot has changed since I launched my last game [Slide: change table]

\item Steam crowding [Slide]

\item No one covered OHOL [Slide]

\item No one covered OHOL [Slide]

\item Dismal units [Slide]

\item Dismal dollars [Slide]

\item All these numbers are an order of magnitude better for TCD

\item Really bad for OHOL.

\item First month curve TCD [Slide]

\item We've all seen this curve

\item Expected curve for game sales

\item Launch day peak with expoential decay

\item Scary thing:  Launch peak of OHOL so much lower [Slide]

\item If expected curve kicks in, we're doomed [Slide]

\item Shocked when day 2 was higher [Slide]

\item And day 3 even higher [Slide]

\item Finally reached peak on day 5, which was actually a Monday [Slide]

\item And we might expect decay curve to kick in [Slide]

\item But the actual curve looks substantially different [Slide]

\item How to account for this?

\item Look at some other launch week differences [Slide]

\item Almost no one made YT vids for TCD [Slide]

\item Almost nobody watched them [Slide]

\item Notice that these numbers are an order of magnitude better for OHOL.

\item So what does this mean?

\item This is a press curve [slide]

\item Press is dead [Slide]

\item Tons of press for Wine [Slide]

\item Even more for Tacoma [Slide]

\item But nobody read any of it

\item I got no press, but it didn't matter [Slide]

\item Here's a game with absolutely no press [Slide]

\item Normal hype curve continues like this in month 2 [Slide]

\item OHOL started month 2 higher, so that's good [Slide]

\item The expected decay curve would look like this [Slide]

\item What actually happened is shocking [Slide]

\item Press, even if people read it, can't do this [Slide]

\item This is a sign of word of mouth.

\item YT videos are one kind of word of mouth.

\item Now look at these games with disappointing sales [Slide:  wine YT]

\item Tacoma did a bit better, but not by much [Slide]

\item Notice the short running times on these videos

\item These are review videos

\item But look at the top video for OHOL [Slide]

\item 24 minutes long, and it's just the guy playing the game [Slide]

\item What about an even more popular game [Slide]

\item Again, another video with someone just playing the game

\item What about other kinds of word of mouth? [Slide:  month 2]

\item What's that spike there?  Xmas day [Slide]

\item Word of mouth only works if people still playing your game in 4 months.

\item Sample from hours listed on front-page Steam reviews [Slide: Wine]

\item These are short games [Slide: tacoma]

\item This is long game [Slide: OHOL]

\item So is this one [Slide: Fish]
