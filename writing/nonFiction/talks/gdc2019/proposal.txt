Your Players Don't Have to Hate Each Other:  Making Complete Strangers Say 'I Love You,' and Mean It

People online hate each other.  This is taken as an axiom.  Behind a digital mask, and through a limited channel of communication, the worst elements of human nature are given room to unfurl.

Add game systems into the online mix, along with their usual player demographic, and it only gets worse, with many online games suffering from player communities that are notoriously negative.  Something must be done!  So report systems are added to punish bad behavior, and reward systems are put in place to encourage good behavior.  But it doesn't really work.  Human nature just can't be tamed, it seems.

But what if it's not human nature?

When the design of my game One Hour One Life first came to public attention a few years ago, it was met with skeptical jeers.  A game where you're born online as a helpless baby, dependent on the good will of a total stranger for your very survival?  Good luck with that, pal!  Every baby will be left to starve---or even worse, murdered outright by trolls-turned-parents---and your budding online civilization will never even get off the ground.  Why would strangers take care of each other?  Human nature will prevail, and this game is obviously doomed.

But the exact opposite happened.  Players were generally good to each other.  Total strangers helped each other, taught each other, and cared for each other.  Some of them even felt and expressed familial love for each other.  At the time of writing, the longest continuous family line lasted 288 generations, more than four solid days of total strangers caring for each other.  How is this possible, given human nature?

How is this possible in real life?  After all, we're all born as helpless babies to total strangers (our parents) who we depend on for survival.  Of course, real life gets to lean on biology, instinct, and tradition, which aren't factors in a game world.

Here's the key insight:  the usual negative social behaviors of people in games and other online systems is not an inevitable consequence of human nature, but instead a rational response to characteristics inherent in the design of those systems.  People aren't idiots.  If negative social behavior is optimal, they will choose that behavior.

But if you design a system where a different kind of behavior is optimal, they will naturally gravitate toward that behavior.  If caring for each other is optimal, so that only idiots won't care for each other, then everyone will gravitate toward caring behavior.

The design of One Hour One Life makes caring optimal by reducing the long-term individual benefit of individual accomplishment.  Everyone only lives for an hour before they get old and die.  All of their progress is lost---unless the next generation survives to carry that progress forward.

Thus, the only meaning in the game comes from being part of a bigger picture, as a branch in the family tree.  A hermit's life is gone without a trace in an hour, and so is the life of a player who lets all of their babies starve to death.

The end result is scene that would seem impossible in an online game filled with total strangers:  at the end of their hour play session, a more experienced player walks around a playfield full to total strangers, says goodbye to everyone, gives the newer players kindly advice, and eventually says, "I love you all," before logging off.

Recast the above situation as an elderly person at the end of their life, walking around their village, saying goodbye, giving advice to their grandchildren, and eventually saying, "I love you all," before dying, and we can see that leaning thematically on real-life situations and traditions helps to make the optimal behavior all that more obvious to players.
