Beyond Single-Player

The creator of /Passage/, /Gravitation/ (Jury Prize, IndieCade 08), and a slew of /Escapist/ Game Sketches shares his thoughts on games as a new expressive form.  To push games forward artistically, we may need to return to the medium's pre-digital roots:  multiple players seated around a game and using it as an interface for communion.  Only multiple players allow game mechanics to blossom into their full, emergent potential.  In the Indie scene especially, we seem to have painted ourselves into the single-player corner and have unwittingly corded ourselves off in the shallow end of the gameplay pool.
