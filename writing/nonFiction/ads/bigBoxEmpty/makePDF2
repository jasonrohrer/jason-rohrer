# generating EPS first is only way to produce a PDF file of custom size
# (pdflatex might do it, but that does not work with embedded EPS files)

# using T1 Times font, which doesn't work well with -P pdf
# fix it with the G0 switch

# dvips -E -P pdf -G0 -o ad2.eps ad2.dvi

# also generate a PS file, just in case we need it

dvips -P pdf -G0 -o ad2.ps ad2.dvi


# actually, need to convert ps file to eps instead of generating eps
# from dvips directly, because dvips screws up in computing the bounding
# box when the background is black
