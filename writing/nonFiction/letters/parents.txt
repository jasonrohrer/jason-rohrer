To my parents:

I have used this time apart from you to do a lot of thinking and reading.  My goal was to figure out how I should handle my relationship with you in the future.

Throughout my relationship with Lauren, interactions with you have put a large strain on both of us.  The best way to summarise the source of these negative interactions is as follows:  your continued desire to control, direct, or somehow influece the way I and my new family live.

In the past, when you have criticized us, I have gone to great lenghts to try to explain and defend our position:  why we are vegan, why we are frugal, why we are car-less, why we compost, why we have homebirths, why we bathe less, why we don't vaccinate, why we don't mow, etc.  I have argued our positions in this way, as I have argued my own positions to you throughout my life, because I always held the hope of finally winning your approval for our choices.

Now I understand that I may never win your approval.  Obviously, I have no direct control over your approval of my life choices, so striving for that approval is unwise---if it comes it comes, but if not, that's okay.

This new insight is liberating.  We can live our life as we choose.  If you criticize our choices in the future, there is no need for any kind of defense or explanation on our part.

With this new non-defensive strategy at our disposal, we are ready to let you back into our lives, albeit on a somewhat limited basis---we don't plan on staying with you at your house in Ohio anymore.

With these letters, I have said the last of what I feel I need to say about my relationship with you.  I have put everything out on the table.  Before resuming regular contact, as suggested above, I would appreciate a letter from each of you in response to my letters.

Jason
