To the Editor:

In response to Tim Connolly's letter about Susan Rice's platform:

I'm probably not the only one who noticed that Tim's overtime analysis is way off the mark.  In fact, anyone who has ever worked as a wage employee must know that overtime simply does not work the way Tim thinks it works.

He gives several examples of "overtime" work that help to maintain our quality of life in the village, including snow removal at 2 a.m., snow plowing jobs that last longer than eight hours, and water main breaks that happen after business hours.  

Of course, none of his examples actually involve overtime.  Working late at night, after business hours, or more than eight hours in a single day have nothing to do with overtime.  The overtime clock only starts ticking when an employee puts in more than 40 hours in a single payroll week.  

If we're going to have a sensible discussion about overtime, it's important that we all understand what overtime is.  My "over 40 hours" characterization should be sufficient, but if you want more details about overtime regulations, a good place to start is the U.S. Department of Labor website (www.dol.gov).

Note: (not to send in with letter)
Some of the relevant details are not covered by the DOL, however.  For example, overtime rules for police and firefighters are different (in a given 28-day period, over 171 hours for police and over 212 hours for fire counts as overtime).
