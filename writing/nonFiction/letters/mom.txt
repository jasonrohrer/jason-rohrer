Mom:

When I was growing up, you seemed to take your job as a parent very seriously, and you came to each new challenge well-prepared.

Being a parent is hard, in part because our instincts tend to mislead us.  Our gut tells us not to let our kids out of our sight.  It takes a strong will to overcome this protective instinct and let our kids go as they grow older.

I saw you working hard to let us go as we grew up.  I found you saying "okay" to more and more.  I found you *not* waiting up when I stayed out late as a young adult.

It was like you had read all the right parenting books and taken them to heart.  Kids do grow up into independent, adult people, so why fight it every step of the way?

Of course, I had to fight with Dad as I grew into independence, but it usually felt like you were on my side.

I guess your parenting books never prepared you for what lay in store for me after college.  The books probably say, "Just make it through those teen years, and then you're in the clear."  After college, most kids get married, get a job, get a mortgage, and settle down.  No more time for life experimentation.

Those books weren't written with me in mind.  There are other adult life paths that are probably also skipped over by the handbooks, like joining a convent (Aunt Ginner), joining a commune (Jim McDade), or a life of service and adventure (Katie Hammond).  Are each of these life paths a parent's worst nightmare?  I guess so.

The upshot is that I've lost my supportive parent, my parent who was game for anything that wasn't physically dangerous.

I miss that parent, and I want her back.
