\item Games do not have spoilers.

\item Games cannot be finished.

\item Games do not have characters, except for the characters who play them.

\item Games do not have stories, except for the stories that players tell through them.

\item Playing a new game is {\it less} like reading a new story, hearing a new song, or seeing a new film.

\item Playing a new game is {\it more} like learning a new language.

\item Games are interfaces, not between minds and content, but between minds.
