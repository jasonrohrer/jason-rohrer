Brace yourself for a brief torrent of negativity.  I've been making video games since 2004---not very long.  I've been playing mainstream games since 1980 or so---as far back as I can remember.  I went through the standard daisy-chain of console love-affairs (7800, NES, SNES, Jag, PS, etc) that has been recounted frequently enough to be boring.  In grade school, I played and loved tons of games, too many to list.  In high school, I was enchanted by the leap to 3D, and plenty of games still blew my mind.  Toward the end of college, however, I became pickier, and fewer games were interesting to me.  /MGS1/ and /2/. /Shenmue/.  /Soul Reaver/.  After college, I spent quite a bit of time hammering on /GTA3/ and /Devil May Cry/.  But since then?  Over the last 6 years?  An extraordinarily-long dry spell.  /Katamari Damacy/.  /Shadow of the Colossus/.  /Portal/.
