Lauren Serafin, Jason Rohrer, Mez and Ayza live in Las Cruces, NM. There they live a life of voluntary simplicity. It took a little planning, but they were able to cut out many of the material needs that they once depended on in order to be able to spend the time they wanted to on their own projects as well as with each other. Instead of working traditional jobs, they are free to seek out interesting projects that sometimes help them make ends meet. They also have free time to do local volunteer work as well.

What is voluntary simplicity? Voluntary simplicity is not something you can look up in a dictionary to find a clear, concise definition of. It's something that is constantly evolving in a person. Heading toward simplicity for me, was to decrease my dependance on material things. It has taken me more than five years to get to where I am now. And I still need a lot of work.   

I grew up in a household where we had more than what we needed. I always had the latest, greatest new toys. I was always wearing the latest fashions. Our family was the first in the neighborhood to get a VCR. And my dad raced out to buy an Apple II C computer as soon as they were released in 1984. But we always wanted more. Every Christmas as the shreds of ripped up wrapping paper flooded the room, and we confirmed that all the gifts had in fact been opened, there was always a feeling of, disapointment. There were other things that we wanted that we didn't get among our piles and piles of gifts that just weren't good enough. My point is, as humans, we always want more. At least I did. And I always saw that all that material stuff just didn't matter. It never really made me happy.

My husband, Jason, grew up in a similar situation and shares my feelings that no matter how much material stuff a person may have, they always want more. No matter how much money a millionare might have, they are not happy because they have not reached billionaire status.

So how did we do it? How did we get rid of it all? Well, we didn't. Often times people hear that we live a simple life but can't understand how that can be when they find out that we have three computers. Living simply doesn't mean that you can't have material things. Jason is a computer programmer who is very passionate about his work. So it only makes sense for us to have computers. What we did was eliminate the things that we felt that we didn't really need. 

There was a free table at my last job where people could leave or take free things (Another great place to give stuff away is www.freecycle.org). I made a comittment to myself to put something on that free table every day for the last three months that I worked there. At first I was putting small trivial things like a little stuffed animal, or some stationary that I had for years and knew I would never use. But towards the end, I was putting nice pieces of china, a boombox, a nice telephone. Watching people dive for these things and sometimes fight over them got me to see how unimportant they were. How I didn't want material things to make me crazy with greed. 

Jason and I were married in Ithaca, NY. Shortly after, we needed to move to Santa Cruz, CA. We had talked about selling our car once we moved and I knew it would have been difficult for me to do this (especially since I was pregnant). But some higher power helped make it easy for me. Our car died when we were moving across the country. We had to junk it in Minnisota and rent a car to continue on to California. What was also helpful for us was that we had to move often right after we got married. Each time we moved, we gave more and more stuff away. Rent being so expensive in California forced us to finally live in a 300 sqare foot apartment (which is where Mez was born). 

When we decided to leave California, we came up with our criteria and then started looking at towns all over the country. Our four criteria were: 1) A place where we could buy a house for a maximun of $50K (that was livable); 2) A place where we could live without a car; 3) A university town; 4) A town with a thriving food co-op. Potsdam, NY was the only town in the country that met all of our criteria. 

Now we are settled into a small house that we own here in Potsdam. We are two stay at home parents. We work here and there as needed to make ends meet. We split up the day with Jason having free time in the morning and me having free time in the afternoon. We created a tight budget to figure out how much money we needed to spend on things such as property taxes, utilities, food, and entertainment. Entertainment is a very small amount of money in our budget, which forces us to find as many free things to do as we can. We almost never go out to eat at restaurants, we almost never go out to the theater to see a movie. We have a wonderful Community Performance Series, where I am able to volunteer my time in exchange for free tickets for me and my family. When anyone needs new clothing, we have been able to find almost everything we need from hand-me-downs from friends, from our local thrift shop, garage sales, or from the various semi-annual rummage sales. 

We are constantly trying to find ways to cut corners. One book that offers many great suggestions to cut costs is The Complete Tightwad Gazette by Amy Dacyczyn. Our home is not pretty, but it's functional and small. There are many things that I would love to fix about our home. I am doing them slowly by myself when I have a little extra money to spare. I could go to work full time and fix many things at once. But then, I would miss out on so much of Mez's growing up. 

When I talk to parents of older children, they always say, "Enjoy this time....it goes by so fast". I am taking their advice seriously. When I walk in the pouring rain with my three year old on an early weekday morning, not in a hurry to get anywhere, I see the simplicity I created. I see people in a hurry trying to get to work on time. Rarely do I see a true smile on their face. We're out just walking. Just being. Not in a hurry. Often times, with no particular place to go. Sure our clothes are a little worn. Mez's jogging stroller looks like it's about to fall apart. But we enjoy what we are doing in that particular moment.
