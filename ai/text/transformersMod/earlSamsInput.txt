Fifteen-thirty on that sunny October day in the early nineteen-seventies in Lake of the Woods, an hour's drive from Indiana, was a normal day. It was a typical county-issue late afternoon: a burst of snow, mostly covering the ground at eight or nine o'clock; an overweight man riding a first-class brown ticket train, in cotton dress and gold plate badge, who was carrying a sapphire metallic briefcase into St. Martinville, Oklahoma City; he stood before the crescent-shaped office of the Mulberry County Auditor; one of those large stainless steel doors opened and a ruggedly handsome man walked out in his tan, easy-looking suit, without his outer appearance a warning sign to any observer. The man was Wendell Sams, chief of police of Mulberry County, and his name was Earl Sams.

Earl Sams had been a cop for nineteen years. He'd been born on this farm in 1917 and made it into adulthood with farm-yard kinbaku and wide experience of the milieu of farmers' wives, country festivals, "cutesy songs and melodies and songs of the land," hunting a pig in a Louisiana cotton field, a hiker frolicking with a deer in the Ozark hills, living in two houses together, raising and maintaining eighty-seven kids, three cars, two planes, and a private railroad and a utility truck. ("It wasn't very good farming and it wasn't very good trucking, but it was only ten miles from downtown Atlanta," Earl Sams had once said.) Then there was the acreage; old-school equipment, all sorts of "pedestrian carts," tailgates and fountains of soft drinks, canned goods, canned food, that dreaded kimchi corn.
