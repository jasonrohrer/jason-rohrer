My name is Max. My world is fire and blood. Once I was a cop, a road warrior searching for a righteous cause. As the world fell, each of us in our own way, was broken. It was hard to tell who was more crazy, me or everyone else. Here they come again, worming their way into the black matter of my brain. I tell myself they cannot hurt me, they are long dead. I am the man who runs from both the living and the dead. Hunted by scavengers. Haunted by those I could not protect. A man reduced to one instinct: survive.
