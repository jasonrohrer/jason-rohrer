Jiggy Juts wanted to eat some popcorn on the airplane, but the airplane was a UFO. Everyone on the plane didn't know it was a UFO. Then the UFO started to land. Jiggy Juts looked out the window and saw an owl that had two beaks, one hundred eye balls, and a feather duster. Then he saw that it was flying over a green liquid, and the liquid had two feather dusters, a TV set, what looked to be an owl-shaped cup, and a bunch of other things. Meanwhile, the plane was landing in the liquid. Then Jiggy Juts heard the loud speaker. It said, "We are landing in what looks to be a green smoothie, evacuate the airplane. Get out the straws, the spoons, and the whipped cream. Yawn." Jiggy Juts looked out the window again, and he saw the airplane was sinking into the liquid, and the plan's floor started turning green.
