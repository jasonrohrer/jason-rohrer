On January 8, 2008, the Town Board passed a $3,200,000 bond resolution to fund the construction of the new Town Hall, which will be sited on outer Lawrence Avenue in the Village of Potsdam.<br>
<br>
According to New York State Law, bond resolutions for town building construction are subject to permissive referendum.  That means that if we gather enough signatures in 30 days, the bond resolution must be put to a town-wide vote for approval or disapproval.  According to the permissive referendum law, based on past voter turnouts, we need at least <b>158 signatures</b>.  The deadline is <b>Feburary 7, 2007</b>.<br>
<br>
If you would like to help us, you can download and print petition forms and instructions.  <b>Please read the instructions carefully</b> so that you don't waste your own time by gathering signatures improperly.<br>
<br>
<b>Do not</b> turn your completed petition sheets in to the town clerk yourself.  They all need to be bound together to count as one petition.  You can return completed sheets, by mail or in person, by <b>Monday, Feb 4</b> to:
