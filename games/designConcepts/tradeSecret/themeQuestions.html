Subject: Design Update
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

Spent much of the day yesterday in my back yard brainstorming on paper.
It was a struggle (this part always is), and it wasn't until 16 pages of
notes in, toward the very tail end of the day, that lightning struck,
and it all felt like it was coming together.  Now that I have the
foundation of the design, I'm in this euphoric phase where the great
ideas are coming faster than I can keep up with.

So I expect to get a document to you sometime very soon!  That's good
news.


One question:  the mechanics that I came up with would pretty much work
with any scenario involving corporate agents exploiting some region for
non-renewable resources.  The game plays out on a map split into
regions... that map could be anywhere.  Some scenarios that I'm
considering are:

--Extracting conflict diamonds from central africa

--Extracting oil from the middle east

--Big pharma exploiting rainforest regions of south america

--Setting up factories in some third-world country (like China,
Indonesia)


Now, those are all hot-button issues, each in their own way.  But I've
been doing some ESRB research, and there doesn't seem to be a "Content
Descriptor" that applies.  "Suggestive Themes" only applies to sexual
stuff (flirting, short skirts, etc.), and "Violent References" only
applies to descriptions of actual violence.  The list above contains
morally ambiguous situations, not "criminal acts," or whatever it is
that the ESRB cares about.  So I'm guessing that any one of these could
get an E rating.

Anyway, my current favorite is the African diamond one.  It really fits
best with the mechanics of limited trust, because if you are De Beers,
and you've got these agents out there in Africa buying rough diamonds
from warlords... well... how *can* you trust them?  They're like
corporate mercenaries.  It also really makes sense that individual
agents are harvesting and returning the resource (because diamonds can
be carried easily, unlike oil).  There's also TONS of very juicy stuff
about this topic, like the Kimberley Process that the UN passed in 2002
to limit the trade in conflict diamonds, or the notion of a worldwide
network of "diamond bourses" with intriguing names like the DUBAI
DIAMOND EXCHANGE.

I mean, what is a "bourse"?  I still haven't figured that out yet!


So, before I do too much more thinking about theme... is the diamond
thing green-light-able?  If not, what about the others?
