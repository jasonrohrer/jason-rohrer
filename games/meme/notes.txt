Working on several improvements.

--Changed population number diamonds to black.

--Started working on tile legend

--Making improvements to rules.


December 5, 2005

First playtest with Lauren.

Seemed like there was too much money (we never felt short of money... money
was not a factor).


Started game and removed 7 tiles in 30 minutes...  thus, the full game would
be about 2 hours long.  Maybe it could be 1 hour long for experts who know
all the rules


Other concern (it didn't happen in our game, but it could have):

What if, during the beginning of the game, the first player "terrorizes" the
other players, moving into their cities and blocking them from populating.
The first player could do this easily (even if the other city is far across
the map by using the 4-token move-anywhere rule) while still keeping some
believers around her own city to populate and earn more tokens.  The first
player could continue to follow the other players' lone believers around,
ruining their chances to populate by moving into whatever cities they go to.

Thus, player 1 has a huge advantage.

So, how to fix this particular problem?  Ideas:

--Players get to start with the number of believers listed on the city they 
  pick.
  (Problem:  too many believers around at beginning of game.  First player
   could end up with 10 believers to move in her first turn.  She could
   then still terrorize the other players and prevent them from ever getting
   a second batch of believers)

--Players start out with zero tokens, and get only 3 free tokens per turn, 
  so they cannot execute a "4-token move-anywhere" on their first turn.
  (Problem:  if two players' starting cities are closer than 3 hops apart,
   the first player can still terrorize the second... what if players build
   a map where all cities are clustered together?)

--Players all step through the turn process together, each doing the Convert
  step, each doing the Attract step, etc.  This would ensure that they
  all populate before any of them move.
  (Problem: slows the game down, since we remove 1/4 the tiles for a given
   amount of activity)

--Change so that the Move step happens before the Populate step.
  (Problem:  there's no way to challenge a player's dominance of a population
   area before she gets to populate from it)
  Still, it makes sense that new-born believers cannot move around at all.
  But there is an asymmetry here, since you can move to a tile and populate
  from it right away, but you cannot move to a tile and collect tokens from
  it right away.
 

In general, the move step being last is ideal, since a player's position
can always be challenged before she gets to act on it.  However, our
problem is that a player's position might be challenged before his first
turn.

If we want to keep the game rules simple and avoid special cases, we might
not be able to prevent first-turn terrorism in all cases.  However, we could
adjust the starting states so that, if players are smart, they can avoid it.

For example, if we give players less money to start, that will prevent
terrorism in most cases.  If players really build a map with cities clustered
together, they are setting the first player up for a supreme advantage. 

In fact, no matter how players get to place believers on the map, the first
player to move has some advantage.  This is probably true of all turn-based 
strategy games, however.  Think of the first player advantage in Risk.

Think about this problem more.

For now, players should start out with zero tokens and get only 3 free tokens
per turn.  This is actually good, since it makes the tiles in the immediate
area of each player's first city more important.  It is not enough to pick
a heavily-populating city---you need a city that is surrounded by good tiles.

Change the rules to reflect this.


Tangent:

On idea is to let the first player build the entire map, but then have that
player go last when placing his first believer.

Thus, the first player gets the best advantage by building a map that is 
well-balanced and has good starting positions for all the players.


Another idea:

What if you had to have 5 beleivers present before you could collect five more
believers from a city with a population number of 5?  What if you had to have 
5 believers present in a 5-token countryside before collecting 5 tokens.

So, if you have 5 believers on the map, you must decide where to use them:
Keep them in the city to generate more believers, or send them to the 
countryside to generate tokens.  With the current rules, players can do both
by sending one believer to the countryside.

Maybe this makes it too hard to dominate any tiles.  It also makes the rules
more complicated.  It definitely seems interesting, though.  It also is less
abstract, since a large population of sheep (on a "token-rich" tile) would
take many people to tend and harvest it.

Actually, I like this idea a lot.  Think about it more.


I guess it seems to make it too complicated.


Now going back to finish point track artwork.


Finished new point track... it looks good.


Printing second prototype.




December 4, 2005

First playtest with printed tiles:

Game works pretty well.  

Point distributions on tiles make for interesting play, even when playing
against yourself.


Money too scarce, plus a player can become frozen if
she runs out of money and no longer dominates any countrysides.

To solve this problem, each player collects 5 tokens plus extra tokens for
dominated countrysides.  

Changing rules to reflect this.

One of the tiles was missing some token number labels.

Fixed this.


Play area too big.  Tiles ~ 3.5 inches square.
A densly-packed play grid (5 tiles x 6 tiles) is 17.5 x 21 inches.

Risk board is ~ 21 x 22 inches.

However, larger tiles look more interesting.  Another problem is that 6 tiles
are a tight fit on a piece of paper with no room for crop marks.

6 tiles are 10.5 x 7

What about 3-inch tiles

6 tiles would be 9 x 6.  That seems better.

Then we'd have room for half-inch crop marks on all sides, producing a full
image that is 10 x 7.

Did this, and added crop marks... New tile sheets look good.


Point track is a bit confusing with Convert, Attract, etc. connected to the
lines that come out of the loop.  Also, likes sticking out of circle don't
look that good.


Made many improvements.

Just found a major bug in the score track numbering (we skip 15 and go right
to 20).

Switching to a 24-point round track.  Still working on this.




December 3, 2005

Finished point track.

Finished first draft of rules.

Time to print?

Landscape features so far:
--Hills
--Mountains
--Leaf trees
--Pine trees
--Swamp
--Cattails
--Lake
--River
--Fish
--Yak
--Sheep


Now need to come up with a plan for placing these features onto the various
tiles.  Our hand-tweaked list of countryside tiles, copied from below:


Countryside:

9  (t=1)  Swamp with cattails
8  (t=2)  Dense mountain range
7  (t=1)  Sparse hills (desert dunes)
7  (t=2)  Tundra (sparse pine trees with a few mountains)
6  (t=1)  Swamp with river going through it
6  (t=2)  Sparse mountains, no trees
6  (t=2)  Small lake in mountains, no rivers, no fish
6  (t=3)  Sparse Leaf tree forest, several hills
5  (t=2)  Small lake in hills (with leaf trees), no rivers, few fish
5  (t=2)  Sparse pine forest bordering mountains
5  (t=3)  Mountainous Tundra with a few yak
5  (t=3)  Sparse Pine forest, nothing else
5  (t=4)  Dense leaf tree forest, a few hills
5  (t=4)  Small lake in mountains (with pine trees), one river out, few fish
4  (t=3)  Hills and sparse leaf trees with a few sheep
4  (t=4)  Mountain-LESS Tundra with many yak
4  (t=4)  Dense pine forest bordering mountains
4  (t=5)  Large lake in hills, no rivers, lots of fish
3  (t=3)  Hills (no trees) with a few sheep
3  (t=4)  Hills with many sheep
2  (t=5)  Medium lake in hills (with leaf trees), river in and out, some fish
1  (t=5)  Large lake with 2 rivers in, 1 river out, lots of fish


Worried that fish will not be visible on printed version.

In test print, they can be seen, but it's hard to tell what they are.

Make their outlines white to fix the problem.  Did this


Got all tiles done and ready for prototype printing.

Still need to make minor changes to rules...


Total possible score (if all points go to one player), 150.

Could be doubled by temples.  But 600 is a lot of score track.


Score track needs to account for this...  300 total points, players start
at 150.


Too many points... point track is too complicated.

But I put too much work into scores and tiles already to change them for this
reason (will tweak them after playtesting if needed).


Okay... what about a 100-point track that has wrap-around features.

If you hit 100, you leave a believer marker at the 100 mark and start a second
marker at 0.  All players start at the 50 mark.


If a player runs out of believer markers, they cannot place any more on the 
board, but they can reuse believer markers that have been removed from the 
board due to conversions or tile scorings.


Interesting idea about score track:

Have 100 (0 through 99) spots on the main track, and have a side track with
100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600 marks.  Players then start at 300 and 0.


Got an interesting point track done that goes from -150 to +150

Better than ripple filter:  displace map.


Make map with solid noise, detail 4, x16, y16, tileable.
Shrink to 25% size.  Tile to fill a map the size of target image.

Rotate copy of the map 180 degrees so that x and y use different maps.

Apply displace filtern with amplitude 3.5 for both x and y.

Still need to test a printout of this.

Saved a sample noise tile that is the right resolution for 3-inch game tiles
at 600dpi

If print out distortions don't look detailed enough, use a smaller, more
detailed noise tile (shrunk to smaller than 25% before tiling with it).


Having trouble with GIMP memory issues when working with the full-page files.
Probably just need to free-up more disk space.

Focus now must be on getting all tiles done so that playtesting can begin.


November 30, 2005

Good Gimp import resolution for making a 6-inch-wide tile sheet
at 600dpi (3600 pix wide): 919

Eventually need to think about crop marks.

Actually, if we print from Photoshop, we can add crop marks then.


Ripple filter settings:

First, horizontal at 40hz, amp 1
Then, horizontal at 53hz, amp 1
Then, vertical at 40hz, amp 1
Then, vertical at 53hz, amp 1
   
Really, before I do more work in the presentation direction, I need to 
develop a prototype... it can be tea paper.



What about confusion between 6 and 9?  Maybe should avoid those numbers and use only 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8.

Leave it as-is for now, change it if some people report being confused.

Old maps of cities:
http://www.trankebar.net/history/oldmap-uk.htm


Started laying out first sheet of city tiles.

Problem:  Tiles for larger villages look too busy... need to shrink
central village and expand roads.

Did this... much better.

Still one more city to go:
Large walled city with many wall segments and many internal roads and houses.


Also have 22 country tiles to deal with...

Can use forests and mountains on some of them, but what else?

--Lake
--River?
--Swamp
--Farm

To weather an EPS image in GIMP:

-- Render clouds with X,Y=16 and detail higher than 1
-- Add noise
-- Blur a bit
-- Brightness and contrast to get random black streaks and blobs
-- Invert to get white blobs
-- Set layer to lighten only



Want to indicate scores symbolicly with dots without using numerals...

Actually, need to use numerals anyway on the score track, so might as
well use them on the tiles.

But I just don't like the way any of the fonts look

So, redo the scores anyway... we can always go back to old scores.


First, do mechanically-computed scores, then tweak by hand.

Still use old mechanical formula:
Population number and token number based on point score.

( 10 - X ) / 2, rounded down, + 1



8 city tiles have scores of:

9
7
6
5 5
4
3
1

9   (p=1)
7   (p=2)
6   (p=3)
5   (p=3)
5   (p=3)
4   (p=4)
3   (p=4)
1   (p=5)

22 countryside tiles have scores of:

9
8 
7  7
6  6  6  6
5  5  5  5  5  5 
4  4  4  4
3  3
2
1


Full list:

9  (t=1)
8  (t=2)
7  (t=2)
7  (t=2)
6  (t=3)
6  (t=3)
6  (t=3)
6  (t=3)
5  (t=3)
5  (t=3)
5  (t=3)
5  (t=3)
5  (t=3)
5  (t=3)
4  (t=4)
4  (t=4)
4  (t=4)
4  (t=4)
3  (t=4)
3  (t=4)
2  (t=5)
1  (t=5)



Now tweak by hand

City:

9   (p=1)
7   (p=2)
6   (p=3)
5   (p=2)
5   (p=3)
4   (p=4)
3   (p=4)
1   (p=5)


Countryside:

9  (t=1)
8  (t=2)
7  (t=1)
7  (t=2)
6  (t=1)
6  (t=2)
6  (t=2)
6  (t=3)
5  (t=2)
5  (t=2)
5  (t=3)
5  (t=3)
5  (t=4)
5  (t=4)
4  (t=3)
4  (t=4)
4  (t=4)
4  (t=5)
3  (t=3)
3  (t=4)
2  (t=5)
1  (t=5)




Okay... good to stay away from 2-digit numbers anyway.

Got some nice dot patterns, but I think it will be too confusing.
We don't want to make players stop and scratch their heads every time
they're trying to figure out how much a tile is worth.

We could use dot patterns for the population numbers and token numbers,
since those are only 1-5 and familiar because of the dot patterns on dice,
but then they would be confusing because players might think the numbers
have something to do with rolling dice, which they don't

Lots of maps from 1300-1500 AD:
http://www.henry-davis.com/MAPS/LMwebpages/LML.html




Ideas about tile scores:

30 tiles, ideally 3 inch by 3 inch.

8 city tiles with population number
22 countryside tiles with token number


Point score X from 1 to 10

Population number and token number based on point score.

( 10 - X ) / 2, rounded down, + 1


Tweak this by hand a bit to make more interesting.


8 city tiles have scores of:

10  (p=1)
