Decided to move the village court to reject the Notice of Appeal as invalid 
because it contains fatal defects in wording.

Court clerk informed me that I should specify a return date on the motion at
least 14 days in the future and on a Wednesday at 9:30.

I also need to file an affidavat of service.

Prepared:  

--Motion complete with return date
--Affidavit of service
--Letter of service to Lekki
