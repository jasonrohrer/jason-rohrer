&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Appeal of a conviction under a municipal by-law which
prohibited naturalized gardens.&nbsp;&nbsp;The appellant challenged the
validity of the by-law as a violation of the Canadian Charter
of Rights and Freedoms.&nbsp;&nbsp;The appellant also argued that the
by-law was invalid because it exceeded the City's delegated
legislative authority and because it was void for vagueness and
uncertainty.&nbsp;&nbsp;The by-law, which required that residential yards
be kept free of excessive growth of weeds and grass, had been
supplemented by a new by-law that prohibited grass and weeds
over 20 centimetres in height.&nbsp;&nbsp;The appellant's garden was
found to violate the by-law simply because of its appearance,
and not on the grounds of any health concern, fire hazard or
other nuisance.
</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>HELD:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Appeal allowed.&nbsp;&nbsp;The conviction was set aside and an
acquittal was entered.&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 7(c) of the by-law was found
invalid, both because it was void for vagueness and uncertainty
and because it unjustifiably violated the freedom of expression
guaranteed by section 2(b) of the Charter.&nbsp;&nbsp;While some of the
goals of the by-law were sufficiently important to justify
overriding a constitutional right, the objective of creating
neat, conventionally pleasant yards did not warrant a complete
denial of the right to express the values and beliefs reflected
by naturalistic gardens.&nbsp;&nbsp;The word excessive in the by-law was
completely subjective and essentially arbitrary, and provided
no guidance to allow courts to reasonably interpret the word or
devise a test that achieved the legislative objective.

<B>FAIRGRIEVE PROV. J.</B>:&#151; At issue in this appeal is
the validity of the City of Toronto by-law which has the
effect, it appears to be conceded, of prohibiting so-called
"wild" or "naturalized" gardens.&nbsp;&nbsp;The specific provision in
question is the section of the Housing By-law under the
heading, "Rubbish", which requires that residential yards be
kept free of "excessive growths of weeds and grass".
</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<FONT SIZE=3 COLOR=RED><B>&#182;</B></FONT>&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The appellant was convicted of refusing to comply
with an inspector's order to cut the weeds and grass in her
yard which were alleged to be "excessive".&nbsp;&nbsp;A $50 fine was
imposed.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms. Bell now challenges the by-law on a number of
different bases that, it should be acknowledged, were not as
clearly articulated at trial as they were in this court where
she was represented by counsel.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Klippenstein asserted
that the focus of the appeal should be the appellant's
submission that the impugned portion of the by-law should be
found to be of no force or effect because it violated her
freedoms of expression and conscience guaranteed,
respectively, by s. 2(b) and s. 2(a) of the Canadian Charter
of Rights and Freedoms.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, relying on traditional
municipal law grounds, the appellant argued that the by-law
was invalid both because it exceeded the City's delegated
legislative authority and because it was void for vagueness
and uncertainty.
</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<FONT SIZE=3 COLOR=RED><B>&#182;</B></FONT>&nbsp;3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The parties stated that they had agreed prior to
the appeal that the case should be decided on the Charter
grounds being advanced.&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason given was that the by-law
under which the appellant was convicted has now been
supplemented by a new bylaw which prohibits grass and weeds
over 20 cm. in height, but apparently has the same effect of
prohibiting naturalistic gardens.&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I was informed
that prosecutions remain outstanding under the old by-law
under which Ms. Bell was convicted, its precise wording is no
longer the pressing concern it was once perceived to be.&nbsp;&nbsp;Both
the appellant and the City took the position that they were
more interested in obtaining a judicial opinion concerning the
constitutional validity of such municipal restrictions in
general (even if it were ultimately only obiter dicta from the
Provincial Division) than they were in a determination of the
propriety of Ms. Bell's particular conviction or the
enforceability of the specific provisions of the old by-law.

<FONT SIZE=3 COLOR=RED><B>&#182;</B></FONT>&nbsp;4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In the circumstances, I am prepared to consider
issues that may not be strictly necessary to the disposition
of this appeal, although (contrary to the parties' preference)
I think I should deal with the non-constitutional grounds
first.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am aware of the directions given by appellate courts
that if a court can decide a case on its merits without
considering constitutional issues, then it should do so:&nbsp;&nbsp;see
Bisaillon v. Keable, [1983] 2 S.C.R. 60 at p. 71, 7 C.C.C.
(3d) 385; Skoke-Graham v. The Queen, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 106 at
pp. 121-122, 17 C.C.C. (3d) 289; R. v. Martin (1991), 2 O.R.
(3d) 16 at p. 30, 63 C.C.C. (3d) 71 at p. 85 (C.A.).&nbsp;&nbsp;At the
same time, I appreciate that the minor consequences of the
trial judgment hardly warranted the cost or effort involved in
bringing this appeal.&nbsp;&nbsp;There have also been more recent
authoritative statements recognizing an accused's right to
raise issues relating not only to his "culpability", which
would be sufficient to dispose of a case, but also to the
constitutionality of the law under which he was prosecuted,
and I do not think consideration of the Charter issues here
would be inconsistent with that approach:&nbsp;&nbsp;see, for example,
R. v. Keegstra (1995), 98 C.C.C. (3d) 1 at p. 11, 39 C.R.
(4th) 205 (S.C.C.); R. v. Laba (1994), 94 C.C.C. (3d) 385, 34
C.R. (4th) 360 (S.C.C.).
</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<FONT SIZE=3 COLOR=RED><B>&#182;</B></FONT>&nbsp;5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I should make it clear, however, that I am not
purporting to decide in this case whether the new by-law,
which is not in issue here, would survive Charter scrutiny,
even if a constitutional challenge to it would presumably
require the same kind of analysis that is required here and, I
assume, lead to the same conclusion.&nbsp;&nbsp;In RJR-MacDonald Inc. v.
Canada (Attorney General) (1995), 100 C.C.C. (3d) 449 at p.
526 (S.C.C.), La Forest J. quoted with approval the following
passage from the judgment of Dickson C.J.C. in Edwards Book &#38;
Art Ltd. (1986), 30 C.C.C. (3d) 385 at p. 436 (S.C.C.):

On October 28, 1993, the appellant was tried and
convicted by Justice of the Peace A. Walton on a charge
alleging that she on the 4th day of August, 1993, at 113
Pickering Street, Toronto, did commit the offence of failing
to comply with an Order dated June 30, 1993, contrary to the
City of Toronto By-law No. 73-68, s. 36.&nbsp;&nbsp;There was really no
issue concerning the facts allegedly constituting the offence.
Ms. Bell admitted that she was the owner of the property at
113 Pickering Street.&nbsp;&nbsp;She also admitted that she had received
an order from a building inspector under the by-law that she
remove debris and that she cut the weeds and tall grass at
that location.&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no issue that while she removed the
debris as ordered, she failed to comply with the remainder of
the order concerning her weeds and grass.

The only prosecution witness was Vito Furlano, a
City of Toronto building inspector.&nbsp;&nbsp;He testified that after
Ms. Bell had been given more than 15 days to comply with the
order, he inspected her property to find that the growth of
grass and weeds was, as he stated, "about one foot in height,
excessively too high".

Ms. Bell gave evidence in her defence.&nbsp;&nbsp;She
testified that when she moved to the property in 1990, its
"front lawn" had three plants, a Virginia creeper vine, sedum,
and Kentucky bluegrass.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms. Bell testified that since that
time, she had added a number of perennials to create what she
considered to be "an environmentally sound wild garden".&nbsp;&nbsp;The

Ms. Bell also stated in her evidence that none of

Also on behalf of the defence, Ms. Bell called
Jane Hayes, a University of Toronto environmental studies
student who had lived at her house from 1991 to 1993.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms.
Hayes testified that she had assisted the appellant in
planting the wild garden at that time.&nbsp;&nbsp;She agreed that the
"bio-diversity" of the garden was important to the
neighbourhood since it attracted insects, worms and birds, and
avoided the use of pesticides that killed off the natural
insect population.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms. Hayes testified as well that although
she participated in the care of the garden, it was true that
no one ever cut the lawn.

Ms. Bell took the position in her evidence at
trial that since neither the word "excessive" nor "weeds" was
defined in the by-law, it failed to impose a clear standard
and that it should be considered void for vagueness.&nbsp;&nbsp;Her
actual submissions were not transcribed, but the parties
accepted that the appellant's claim to be exempt from the
by-law raised the Charter issues that were advanced by Mr.

In his reasons for finding the appellant guilty,
after expressing sympathy for the appellant's beliefs, the
learned justice of the peace stated that her concerns should
properly be addressed to City Council.&nbsp;&nbsp;He ruled that
"excessive weeds" were terms that could be found in the
dictionary, and without expressly analyzing or articulating
the reasons why the appellant's garden fell within the
by-law's proscription, he found the appellant guilty.

In accordance with the informal appellate

Recent photographs taken of the appellant's front
and back yards were filed as exhibits.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is fair to
say that they showed what to the uninitiated would appear to
be an untended plot with tall grass and weedlike plants, in
marked contrast to the carefully manicured conventional lawn
and garden in the front yard of the semi-detached house
adjoining the appellant's.&nbsp;&nbsp;Apparently designed to show their
contrasting tastes, one photograph showed the open front
porches of the two dwellings, the neighbour's with matching
white wicker furniture and the appellant's with a collection
of worn-out mismatched upholstered chairs.

Two expert witnesses were called by the
appellant.&nbsp;&nbsp;Harry Merrens, a York University geography
professor, is a landscaping historian specializing in the
relationship between people and their environment.&nbsp;&nbsp;He
described his field as including the study of "the way in
which [people's] behaviour in modifying the earth is mediated
through their perceptions, values and beliefs".&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Merrens
testified that landscaping has an identifiable historical and
social dimension, and he described the evolving styles of the
designed landscape in Western Europe and North America over
the last three or four hundred years.&nbsp;&nbsp;It has moved, he
stated, from the rigid geometry of large French gardens in the
late 17th century to the "unstructured, romantic, natural"
gardens of 18th century England, which were followed by more
orderly symmetrical Victorian garden designs.&nbsp;&nbsp;This series of
styles, according to Prof. Merrens, represented the imposition
of certain values on the landscape.
</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<FONT SIZE=3 COLOR=RED><B>&#182;</B></FONT>&nbsp;23&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
With respect to current residential landscaping
practices in North America, Prof. Merrens testified that
domestic gardens typically involve straight peripheries
marking property lines by neatly clipped hedges or highly
ornamental flower beds accompanied by closely cropped grass.
According to his evidence, this ubiquitous pattern reflects a
belief or value system which carries "a commitment to the
achievement of certain static effects that are considered
attractive, by manipulating, dominating or manicuring the
environment", and which expresses an urge to dominate or
control nature to achieve particular pictorial effects.
</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<FONT SIZE=3 COLOR=RED><B>&#182;</B></FONT>&nbsp;24&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In contrast to prevailing practices, however,
Prof. Merrens testified that during the last 20 or 25 years in
North America, an increasing number of people have adopted a
different model with a more restrained approach to controlling
nature.&nbsp;&nbsp;While the movement has produced a variety of forms,
they are usually lumped together and described simply as
"naturalistic gardens".&nbsp;&nbsp;These gardens, he stated, reflect
different ecological or environmental goals.&nbsp;&nbsp;They involve a
commitment to living in greater harmony with nature, not
stunting or altering nature, but allowing it to express itself
in a more spontaneous way.&nbsp;&nbsp;Such gardens still involve some
degree of control, with many emphasizing native, rather than
non-native, plant species, but they eliminate the need for
chemical herbicides, pesticides and power tools to control
shrubbery or grass, and they reduce the use of water.&nbsp;&nbsp;People
who are part of the naturalistic gardening movement are
generally motivated by a philosophy with ecological, economic
and spiritual goals that seek a more harmonious and
restorative relationship with nature.

<FONT SIZE=3 COLOR=RED><B>&#182;</B></FONT>&nbsp;25&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
James Hodgins was the other expert in
naturalistic landscaping who testified on behalf of the
appellant.&nbsp;&nbsp;Educated as a biologist, Mr. Hodgins is the editor
of Wildflower Magazine, a founding director of the Canadian
Wildflower Society and the Field Botanists of Ontario, a
former director of the Federation of Ontario Naturalists, and
a member of the Canadian Nature Federation and Eastern Native
Plant Alliance.&nbsp;&nbsp;He is also a co-author of a book, Flowers of
the Wild, Ontario and the Great Lakes Region, published by the
Oxford University Press, which has so far sold over 8,000
copies.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Hodgins testified that the naturalistic
landscaping movement has spread rapidly in recent years in
Toronto and across North America.&nbsp;&nbsp;Many municipalities and
university campuses now have naturalized gardens; the public
property examples in Toronto he cited include the extensive
restoration project in High Park and the naturalized woodlawn,
prairie and marsh gardens in the new Yorkville Park.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr.
Hodgins estimated that there are now between two and three
thousand naturalized residential gardens in the City of
Toronto.
</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<FONT SIZE=3 COLOR=RED><B>&#182;</B></FONT>&nbsp;26&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Concerning the building inspector's evidence at
trial that the plants in the appellant's front yard were a
foot high, Mr. Hodgins testified that about 90 per cent of
native plant species grow higher than that.&nbsp;&nbsp;The 20-cm. height
limit in the new by-law, he testified, would eliminate golden
rod, New England asters and evening primrose, all of which are
part of the native plant community generally regarded as
"weeds".&nbsp;&nbsp;As well, many grasses grow over a foot high, with
Mr. Hodgins pointing to a half dozen species of grasses, all
of which are over a metre in height, which grow in the flower
beds outside the Toronto City Hall.&nbsp;&nbsp;According to his
evidence, the effect of a 20-cm. height restriction (which he
described as "bizarre, incomprehensible and arbitrary") would
be to "sterilize" and "devastate" naturalized gardens, both
aesthetically and ecologically.
</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<FONT SIZE=3 COLOR=RED><B>&#182;</B></FONT>&nbsp;27&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Mr. Hodgins further testified that while one can
find the word "weed" in dictionaries, it is a subjective,
relative term that has no scientific standing.&nbsp;&nbsp;Golden rod,
for example, is generally considered a weed in North America,
but in England and Germany is regarded as an expensive
ornamental plant.
</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<FONT SIZE=3 COLOR=RED><B>&#182;</B></FONT>&nbsp;28&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Finally, Mr. Hodgins testified that one can
readily distinguish naturalized gardens, with their planned
choice and diversity of native species, from the neglected or
derelict yard where a dozen or so rural or Eurasian species
would quickly move in and take over.&nbsp;&nbsp;Doing nothing and simply
allowing the forces of nature to prevail is inconsistent with
naturalistic landscaping, he stated, which by definition
requires a human presence in the garden.&nbsp;&nbsp;Having viewed the
appellant's front yard in 1994, Mr. Hodgins testified that
about 95 per cent of the species had apparently been
deliberately planted.&nbsp;&nbsp;Without suggesting that the appellant's
yard should be viewed as a model naturalized garden, his
opinion clearly was that it was distinguishable from the
uncontrolled weed patch that one might associate with an
abandoned vacant lot or a yard completely neglected by its
owner.

A municipality can exercise only those powers
which are explicitly conferred by a provincial statute:&nbsp;&nbsp;see
R. v. Greenbaum (1993), 100 D.L.R. (4th) 183 at p. 192
(S.C.C.).&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Wall submitted that s. 7(c) of By-law No. 73-68
was validly passed by the City of Toronto under the authority
conferred by s. 6(2) of the City of Toronto Act, supra,
permitting by-laws "fixing a standard of fitness for human
habitation to which all dwellings must conform" and
"prohibiting the use of dwellings which do not conform to such
standard".
</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<FONT SIZE=3 COLOR=RED><B>&#182;</B></FONT>&nbsp;30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
While Mr. Wall conceded that the City was not
permitted to impose standards based on aesthetic preferences
alone, he took the position that the prohibition against
"excessive growths of weeds and grass" was properly viewed as
part of the regulation of housing standards authorized by the
Act.&nbsp;&nbsp;He pointed to the title of the by-law, purporting to
provide "standards of repair and maintenance of dwellings and
to prevent overcrowding of dwellings", as a clear indication
of its valid purpose, although I think it is still necessary
to articulate how the "standards" imposed actually relate to
the authorized area of regulation.
</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<FONT SIZE=3 COLOR=RED><B>&#182;</B></FONT>&nbsp;31&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Even if the standard of maintenance imposed by s.
7(c) is partly or even primarily aimed at avoiding eyesores or
visual blight and, in the process, contributing to an
appearance of well-maintained residential neighbourhoods, I do
not think it follows that it exceeds the authority conferred
by s. 6(2) of the enabling statute.&nbsp;&nbsp;In Ramsden v. City of
Peterborough (1993), 106 D.L.R. (4th) 233 at p. 247 (S.C.C.),
Iacobucci J. accepted that one of the objectives of a
municipal by-law which prohibited affixing posters on public
property was the avoidance of "aesthetic blight"; he not only
did not consider this an improper goal, but went on to
characterize this concern as "pressing and substantial".&nbsp;&nbsp;That
the anti-weed by-law has an incidental effect of enforcing
aesthetic standards which accord with conventional landscaping
tastes is no reason, in my opinion, to regard it as exceeding
the City's powers conferred by s. 6(2) of The City of Toronto
Act, 1936.
</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<FONT SIZE=3 COLOR=RED><B>&#182;</B></FONT>&nbsp;32&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In any event, quite apart from a desire to avoid
unsightly and messy-looking premises, there appear to be valid
public health concerns addressed by the by-law's prohibition
of "excessive weeds and grass".&nbsp;&nbsp;It is common knowledge that
many weeds are poisonous or "noxious", to use the word usually
used in this context, and some can cause allergic reactions.
While perhaps not of the same magnitude as health hazards
posed by rotting garbage or open sewers, there is no need to
minimize the danger created by, for example, deadly nightshade
for small children or even ragweed for hay fever sufferers.
</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<FONT SIZE=3 COLOR=RED><B>&#182;</B></FONT>&nbsp;33&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Similarly, without wishing to exaggerate the
situation, overgrown dry grass and weeds can be seen as a
potential fire hazard.&nbsp;&nbsp;Grass fires on Los Angeles hillsides
threatening residential neighbourhoods, judging by the nightly
news at least, seem to be routine occurrences, and it seems
sensible that to ensure the safety of dwellings here, the City
of Toronto would have standards governing residential
properties that are aimed at avoiding similar conditions.&nbsp;&nbsp;If
one is inclined to think that such fire hazards are limited to
dry, southwestern climates and do not apply to damp Ontario,
it is interesting that in R. v. Canadian Pacific Ltd. (1995),
99 C.C.C. (3d) 97 (S.C.C.), the alleged environmental offence
involved controlled burns of dry grass and weeds on a Kenora
railway right-of-way which, it was accepted, posed a potential
fire hazard.
</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<FONT SIZE=3 COLOR=RED><B>&#182;</B></FONT>&nbsp;34&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
It is also apparent that some weeds cause the
kind of serious environmental harm that can result when, for
example, a foreign plant like purple loosestrife spreads and
disrupts the local ecosystem.&nbsp;&nbsp;Merely because the less serious
damage to lawns caused by, for example, dandelions spreading
from a neighbouring property might seem to be a fairly minor
nuisance, I do not think it is necessarily too trivial for the
municipality to consider in its effort to promote the kind of
residential environment obviously favoured by most residents.
</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<FONT SIZE=3 COLOR=RED><B>&#182;</B></FONT>&nbsp;35&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A similar challenge to the validity of a local
by-law was considered recently in Caledon (Town) v. Mik, [1995]
O.J. No. 4076, (Ont. Prov. Div., December 22, 1995), where Judge
P. Harris found a provision requiring grounds to be kept free
and clear of "materials" and "machinery" to be ultra vires.&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Town claimed to have passed the by-law in the exercise of its
power under s. 210 of the Municipal Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. M.45,
concerning "health, sanitation and safety" and, more
specifically, item 80 referring to the "cleaning, clearing of
any grounds, yards and vacant lots".&nbsp;&nbsp;Harris Prov. J. found,
however, that the by-law in fact was directed to the
unauthorized regulation of aesthetics or the visual appearance
of properties, rather than any legitimate health or safety
concern.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is noteworthy, I think, that at p. 8 of his
reasons, Judge Harris suggested that the references in another
part of the by-law to "garbage, rodents, excessive weed growth
and other unsafe conditions" (emphasis added) were arguably
designed to regulate environmental conditions that could
adversely affect public health, sanitation and safety.&nbsp;&nbsp;In any
event, I do not think that the more general authority conferred
by the City of Toronto Act to regulate the "use and occupancy of
dwellings" needs to be construed as narrowly as the "health,
sanitation and safety" justification relied on by the
municipality in the case decided by Judge Harris.
</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<FONT SIZE=3 COLOR=RED><B>&#182;</B></FONT>&nbsp;36&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Mr. Klippenstein argued that even if the by-law
had a valid purpose that was other than aesthetic in nature,
the Province had already "occupied the field" of weed
regulation, to use his phrase, by enacting the Weed Control
Act, supra.&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to me, however, that while there may
very well be some overlap between the statute and the by-law,
both in terms of some of the health and environmental concerns
they address and the potential duplication when the allegedly
excessive growths are of "noxious weeds" under the Act, the
different provisions have substantially different purposes and
effects.&nbsp;&nbsp;The by-law is directed at standards of maintenance
for dwellings and applies to grass and weeds regardless of
whether they have been designated as "noxious".&nbsp;&nbsp;In Re Allen
and City of Hamilton (1987), 59 O.R. (2d) 498 (C.A.),
MacKinnon A.C.J.O. found no conflict or redundancy between a
by-law requiring land to be kept free of garbage, refuse or
waste and the section of the Planning Act requiring certain
properties to be cleared of debris or refuse.&nbsp;&nbsp;His Lordship

enunciated the appropriate interpretative approach to a

principles of fundamental justice in s. 7 require that
laws provide the basis for coherent judicial
interpretation, and sufficiently delineate an "area of

vague if it so lacks in precision as not to give
sufficient guidance for legal debate" (at p. 313 C.C.C.,

founded on two rationales:&nbsp;&nbsp;the need to provide fair

The appellant's position was that the by-law's
prohibition of "excessive growths of weeds and grass" was so
open-ended that it failed to delineate with sufficient
precision the illegal conduct it sought to proscribe and that
it authorized a "standardless sweep" by enforcement officials.
The uncertainty, it was argued, came from two sources.&nbsp;&nbsp;First,
in accordance with the evidence given by Mr. Hodgins, it was
submitted that the word "weed" had no clear meaning, that it
was a subjective and relative term without any scientific
basis for classifying plants.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was not suggested, however,
that the word "grass", despite its different varieties, posed
the same definitional difficulties.&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, it was submitted
that the by-law provided no standard by which one could assess
whether growths of weeds and grass were "excessive", and that
any test for making such a determination that could be devised
by the courts would necessarily be subjective and arbitrary.
For the same reason, it was submitted, the enforcement of the
by-law turned on subjective and arbitrary decisions by
building inspectors.

With respect to the first objection, I think that
while the word "weed" may have some botanical ambiguity,
courts could sensibly categorize the finite number of plant
species according to recognized criteria.&nbsp;&nbsp;I appreciate that
the dictionary definitions of the word may not contribute much
certainty; The Random House Dictionary (1968), for example,
defines "weed" simply as "a valueless, troublesome or noxious
plant growing wild, esp. one that grows profusely or on
cultivated ground to the exclusion or injury of the desired
crop".&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same tune, it is a word of common usage and
there appears to be a consensus in the community certainly
with respect to its application to many plant species.
Evidence could be called, for example, as to whether a plant
was harmful in the sense of posing a health risk or excluding
or damaging other desired plants.&nbsp;&nbsp;Findings could presumably
be made in accordance with such evidence.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, it
appears that the designation of particular plants as "noxious
weeds" under the Weed Control Act would assist in identifying
at least some members of the class.&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it might strain
the language to refer to such a process of labelling plants as
weeds or not a "legal debate" applying "reasoned analysis", it
is nonetheless a procedure which courts could, I think,
undertake if called upon to do so.

Determining when the line is crossed between
acceptable growths of weeds and grass and those that are
"excessive" strikes me as significantly more problematic.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr.
Wall submitted that the phrase "excessive growth of grass and
weeds", when construed in the context of the whole by-law, is
intelligible language that can be interpreted by the courts.
The word "excessive" should be given its normal meaning, he
argued, of "greater in amount or degree than is usual or
necessary or right", and he submitted that anyone applying
common sense would find Ms. Bell's garden unacceptable.
Moreover, Mr. Wall asserted that a by-law enforcement officer
would be in a position to determine whether weeds and plants
were "excessive" and that courts, just as the justice of the
peace did in this case, could rely on the evidence of an
officer's assessment.

I do not find the City's argument in this regard
to be very persuasive.&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not accept that "common sense"
dictates when growths of weeds and grass exceed what is "usual
or necessary or right".&nbsp;&nbsp;Without a prescribed standard against
which to measure such matters, it would surely become a
question simply of personal taste or aesthetic preference.&nbsp;&nbsp;I
have no difficulty thinking that in 1968 when the by-law was
passed, at a time of greater conformity and homogeneity,
perhaps there would have been no confusion as to what the word
"excessive" conveyed in this context.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the more diverse,
pluralistic and accommodating society of the 1990's, however,
I do not think that it is so easily ascertained.&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if a
preference for the typical suburban lawn remains prevalent
(and I am sure it does), I think we have all become accustomed
to accepting that not everyone shares the same tastes, and
that differing practices are no less valid or tolerable simply
because they deviate from the norm.&nbsp;&nbsp;While the by-law may have
been passed for a legitimate purpose, it should be remembered
that Ms. Bell's garden was found to have "excessive growths of
weeds and grass" not because there was any evidence of any
health concern, fire hazard or other nuisance or harm caused
by it, but simply because of its appearance.

Moreover, it seems to me that people's
expectations or standards of tolerance, to use the phrase
normally applied to obscenity and indecency, can change over
time, and that when it comes to landscaping practices, they
obviously have.&nbsp;&nbsp;When one regularly encounters naturalized
areas in High Park or other public spaces, when one sees the
City itself actively encouraging vegetatIon not noticeably
different from that found unacceptable in the appellant's
garden, one's sense of what is "usual or necessary or right"
is naturally affected.&nbsp;&nbsp;I accept Mr. Hodgins' evidence that
there are now thousands of private naturalized gardens in
Toronto, and I think that an inevitable consequence of routine
exposure to them is that they no longer shock one's
sensibilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;One does not necessarily approve of them or
hope for one next door, but there is much in the urban
environment that one accepts simply as part of living in a
largely ugly North American city.&nbsp;&nbsp;Torontonians necessarily
develop an aesthetic immunity to overhead wires, garish signs
and billboards and tacky buildings.&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as landscaping is
concerned, I am sure that many people find, for example, the
long grass and weeds on the hillside abutting the Gardiner
Expressway far less offensive than the nearby commercial
gardens with plants carefully manicured into corporate logos.
The point is not that attempts by a municipality to lessen
visual blight are invalid, but that in defining what is
impermissible, something more certain, precise or intelligible
than the word "excessive" is required.

It would appear that the City itself recognized
the subjective and discretionary nature of the phrase
"excessive growths" in the old by-law when it passed the new
by-law imposing a 20-cm. height restriction.&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to me
that regardless of whether one agrees with the evidence of Mr.
Hodgins that the specified height restriction is "bizarre,
incomprehensible and arbitrary", it at least provides
certainty in enunciating the standard which property owners
must apply in assessing the "area of risk" and which
inspectors must apply in enforcing the by-law.&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other
hand, since there appears to be no obvious correlation between
a height restriction for plants and any health, safety or
environmental hazards posed by them, I think the new by-law
makes it even clearer that the City's concern with weed
control is primarily motivated by aesthetic considerations.

Given that there is no generally-accepted
standard that would compel a finding that wild gardens involve
"excessive" growths of weeds and grass, the question still
remains whether courts can reasonably interpret the word and
devise a test that achieves the legislative objective.&nbsp;&nbsp;In R.
v. Butler, [1992] 1 S.C.R. 452, the Supreme Court managed to
articulate a community standards test for determining whether
there was "undue" exploitation of sex by examining whether the
allegedly obscene item would be perceived by public opinion to
be harmful to society.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have no doubt that courts could
similarly devise a test to determine, for example, the meaning
of "excessive noise" in the context of s. 75 of the Highway
Traffic Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. H.8.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a self-evident
standard, involving the normal sound of traffic or a running
motor, against which the allegedly offending "excessive"
condition could be measured.&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think, however, that
where grass and weeds are concerned, such an objective
standard could be defined.&nbsp;&nbsp;One could in theory inject a kind
of "social harm" test and require the prosecution to prove
that the particular weeds or grass constituted a health or
safety hazard or caused an environmental nuisance.&nbsp;&nbsp;That would
ignore, however, the aesthetic consideration that I am
satisfied was the primary purpose the by-law was designed to
achieve.&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, it was apparent in this case that it was only
the appearance of the appellant's yard that led the inspector
to lay the charge and the court to make the finding of guilt,
both done without any guidance provided by the by-law as to
how visually unacceptable yards were to be determined.

"Expression" has both a content and a form, and the two

it attempts to convey meaning.&nbsp;&nbsp;That meaning is its
content.&nbsp;&nbsp;Freedom of expression was entrenched in our
Constitution and is guaranteed in the Quebec Charter so
as to ensure that everyone can manifest their thoughts,
opinions, beliefs, indeed all expressions of the heart
and mind, however unpopular, distasteful or contrary to
the mainstream.&nbsp;&nbsp;Such protection is, in the words of both

expressive and physical elements, some human activity is
purely physical and does not convey or attempt to convey
meaning.&nbsp;&nbsp;It might be difficult to characterize certain
day to day tasks, like parking a car, as having

There can be no doubt that the appellant's act of
growing a naturalistic garden that included tall grass and
weeds had expressive content and conveyed meaning.&nbsp;&nbsp;As an
environmentalist, Ms. Bell implemented a landscaping form
intended to convey her sincerely held beliefs concerning the
relationship between man and nature.&nbsp;&nbsp;It also implicitly
conveyed a critique of the prevailing values reflected in
conventional landscaping practices.&nbsp;&nbsp;She testified that she
meant to show her son, and presumably the public at large,
that one could co-exist with nature in a peaceful, nurturing
way.&nbsp;&nbsp;In Ross v. School District No. 15, supra at p. 865, La
Forest J. repeated that "the unpopularity of the views
espoused" is not relevant to determining whether their
expression falls within the guarantee of freedom of

Similarly, in my opinion, the appellant's

Divisional Court did in the contact dancing case, that the
importance of the expressive activity is relevant to
determining whether it is entitled to Charter protection (as
opposed to merely being a consideration relevant to the s. 1
analysis if an infringement is found), it can be observed that
the Supreme Court of Canada has in the past found both the act
of affixing an advertisement for a rock band to a utility pole
(Ramsden v. Peterborough (City), supra) and tobacco
advertising (RJR-MacDonald Inc. v. Canada (A.G.), supra) to be
protected forms of expression.&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to me that the
appellant's expressing her environmental beliefs, conveying a
statement about living in harmony with nature, and seeking
self-fulfilment in her gardening practices come much closer to
the "core values" underlying s. 2(b) than the forms of
expression given protection in those cases.

Moving to the second step of the test,
determining whether the purpose or effect of the by-law is to
restrict a person's freedom of expression, I think it is
apparent that one of the purposes of the by-law, indeed its
primary purpose, is to impose on all property owners the
conventional landscaping practices considered by most people
to be desirable, and that one of its effects is to prevent
naturalized gardens which reflect other, less conventional
values.&nbsp;&nbsp;The by-law has a direct effect on the appellant's

The second part of the s. 1 analysis, the
"proportionality test" involves three determinations:
that the measure adopted is rationally connected to the
objective (rational connection); that the measure impair
as little as possible the right or freedom in question
(minimal impairment); and that there be proportionality
between the effects of the measure and the objective.</p></TD>

In my view, the objectives of the by-law can be
identified, as they already have been, as the imposition of
maintenance standards for residential premises which seek to
minimize aesthetic blight and avoid health and fire hazards
and an environmental nuisance.&nbsp;&nbsp;At least some of its
objectives can be seen as sufficiently pressing and
substantial to justify interference with Charter rights.
Similarly, its prohibition of "excessive growths of weeds and
grass" is rationally connected to these objectives, assuming
for the moment that "excessive" could be defined simply to
mean weeds and grass which tend to cause the mischief sought
to be avoided.&nbsp;&nbsp;By prohibiting weeds and grass which are
"excessive" and authorizing building inspectors to order their
removal when they reach that stage, aesthetically offensive
yards and the other potential hazards associated with them are
certainly avoided.

The question then becomes whether the impugned
section of the by-law restricts expression as little as is
reasonably possible.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is apparent that the effect of s.
7(c) is to impose a total ban on wild or naturalized gardens
in private residential yards.&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the evidence, most
grasses and native plants, some of which could properly be
characterized as weeds, grow to a state (and certainly to
heights exceeding 20 cm.) that would be regarded as
"excessive" under the by-law.&nbsp;&nbsp;In Ramsden v. Peterborough
(City), supra at p. 248, Iacobucci J. observed as follows:

While the negation of a right or freedom does not
necessarily require that such an infringement not be
upheld under s. 1, the distinction between a limit that
permits no exercise of a guaranteed right or freedom in a
limited area of its potential exercise and one that
permits a qualified exercise of it may be relevant to the
test of proportionality under s. 1 ([Ford v. Quebec
(Attorney General) (1988), 54 D.L.R. (4th) 577] at p.
624).&nbsp;&nbsp;In Ford, the court held that a complete
prohibition on the use of languages other than French on
commercial signs could not meet the requirements of the
proportionality test, particularly the rational
connection and minimal impairment branches.&nbsp;&nbsp;In contrast,
in Irwin Toy, supra, the court upheld substantial
content-based restrictions (as opposed to a total ban) on
advertising directed at children.&nbsp;&nbsp;It will therefore be
more difficult to just a complete ban on a form of
expression than time, place or manner restrictions.</p></TD>

The City, I think, could justifiably regulate
domestic gardens by prohibiting noxious weeds or dry
combustible grass or plants that cause a fire hazard.&nbsp;&nbsp;The
application of the by-law is not so restricted, however, and
it has been applied in a way that imposes aesthetic standards
with which, according to the testimony of Mr. Hodgins,
naturalized gardens could never comply.&nbsp;&nbsp;It might be suggested
that a word as flexible, and indeed as meaningless, as
"excessive" could be interpreted in a way that would exclude
interference with persons using wild gardens to express their
environmental beliefs.&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, however, that would
require an interpretation of the by-law that disregards its
primary purpose, namely, prohibiting visually offensive yards
which deviate from the landscaping norm and would, as a
result, violate the most basic rule of legislative
construction.

I do not think that it would be impossible for
the City to devise a valid by-law which imposes standards of
"repair" or maintenance of residential yards which avoid a
Charter violation.&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly, not every weed patch or derelict
yard manifests an intention to express one's beliefs or convey
meaning; most, I would think, reflect mere laziness and
indifference.&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be open to the City to draft a by-law
that imposes a duty on neglectful property owners concerning
minimal maintenance standards while exempting from the
operation of the by-law those unconventional gardens which
express their owners' environmentalist values.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is obvious,
however, that a by-law that has the effect of totally banning
wild gardens does not impair as little as is reasonably
possible the right to express the values and beliefs reflected
in such gardens.

Moreover, to use the words of Iacobucci J. in
Ramsden, supra at p. 249, "the benefits of the by-law are
limited while the abrogation of the freedom is total; thus,
proportionality between the effects and the objective has not
been achieved".&nbsp;&nbsp;While at least some of the goals of the
by-law are sufficiently important to justify overriding a
constitutional right (although it should be noted that the
right claimed by the appellant does not include the right to
grow noxious weeds or plants likely to catch fire), the
objective of creating neat, conventionally pleasant
residential yards does not warrant a complete denial of the
right to express a differing view of man's relationship with
nature.&nbsp;&nbsp;As between a total restriction of naturalistic
gardens and causing some offence to those people who consider
them ugly or inconsiderate of others' sensibilities, some
offence must be tolerated.&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, the by-law cannot be
justified under s. 1.

Having found that the by-law unjustifiably
infringes the appellant's freedom of expression guaranteed by
s. 2(b) of the Charter, pursuant to s. 52(1) of the
Constitution Act, 1982, it is of no force or effect.&nbsp;&nbsp;In those
circumstances, I do not think it is necessary to consider
whether it also has the effect of breaching the appellant's
freedom of conscience guaranteed by s. 2(a).

Section 7(c) of By-law No. 73-68 is found
invalid, both because it is void for vagueness and
uncertainty, and because it unjustifiably violates the freedom
of expression guaranteed by s. 2(b) of the Charter.&nbsp;&nbsp;The
appeal is accordingly allowed, the conviction set aside, and
an acquittal entered.&nbsp;&nbsp;The fine which has been paid will be
remitted to the appellant.&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, the appellant is also
entitled to her costs of the appeal, pursuant to s. 129 of the
Provincial Offences Act.&nbsp;&nbsp;If counsel are unable to agree as to
quantum of the costs to be paid by the respondent, the matter
may be brought before me within 30 days of the release of
these reasons.
